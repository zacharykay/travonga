Mount Stuart is definitely a must-see attraction.</p><p>Afterwards if you still have time you might consider seeing the ruins of the small 13th century <strong>Rothesay Castle</strong> located in the middle of the island's largest town, for which the castle is named. From Rothesay you can take a ferry or car ferry back to the town of Skelmorlie on the Scottish mainland, which is about 45 minutes away from Glasgow by car.</p>",

Ullapool is quite small, however it is one of the largest towns of the Northwestern Highlands and hosts many hotels and restaurants. Additionally, you can take a tour boat from Ullapool's harbor in the warmer months to enjoy the wild landscape of the Highlands from the coast. From Ullapool, it's possible to take the ferry or car ferry across to the Isles of Lewis and Harris.</p>",
