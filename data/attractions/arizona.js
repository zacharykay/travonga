				body: `<p>The majestic Canyon de Chelly National Monument is situated around a long deep canyon, not as deep as the Grand Canyon but somewhat similar. You can drive along the northern and southern rims of the canyon to enjoy the various viewpoints along the Canyon de Chelly.</p>
				<p>It's highly recommended to see as many viewpoints as possible. Since this canyon follows a much more winding path than the Grand Canyon, each viewpoint offers very different scenery, with some even looking out over ancient Native American cliff dwellings.</p>`,

				heading: 'Southern Canyon Overlooks',
				anchor: null,
				carousel_id: 'carousel_1',
				body: `<p>Most of the main viewpoints are located along the southern rim of the canyon. Coming from the Visitor Center, you'll first reach the Tunnel Overlook, which isn't very impressive on its own, however with a ranger-led tour, this overlook acts as a trailhead for hiking down into the canyon.</p>
				<p>A bit further along the road you can stop at the <strong>Tsegi Overlook</strong>, followed by the <strong>Junction Overlook</strong> and then the <strong>White House Overlook</strong>. All of these viewpoints arehighly recommended.</p>
				<h3>White House Ruin Trail</h3>
				<p>The White House Overlook provides views of an incredible Native American cliff dwelling within the canyon. From this overlook you have the option of hiking the 2.7 mile (4.3 km) round-trip <strong>White House Ruin Trail</strong>, which takes you to the bottom of this gorgeous canyon and up-close to the cliff dwellings. This is actually the only public trail within the park, as other trails are accessible only via a ranger-led tour.</p>`,

				carousel_id: null,
				body: `<p>Continuing along the southern canyon you can stop to enjoy the view at the Sliding House Overlook, followed by Face Rock Overlook.</p>
				<p>Adjacent to the Face Rock Overlook is the canyon's most iconic sight, Spider Rock. The <strong>Spider Rock Overlook</strong> offers breathtaking views high above this famous rock pillar (Spider Rock), which towers high above the valley floor between several canyons. The best time to see Spider Rock is approximately mid-day, when the sun is high in the sky with minimal shadows, since this canyon is quite deep and thin.</p>`,

The first stop along the northern side is the <strong>Antelope House Overlook</strong>, which offers views over another cliff dwelling set amongst the beautiful canyon. This viewpoint requires a short but worthwhile walk.</p>
				<p>Continue along to the second best view in the park, the <strong>Mummy Cave Overlook</strong>, which offers views over extraordinary cliff dwellings set amongst a very picturesque part of the canyon. This viewpoint also offer the best views in the monument over ancient cliff dwellings. Nearby you might like to also take in views from the Massacre Cave Overlook.</p>`,

Both of these trails pass by the <strong>Coconino Overlook</strong> as well, which by itself can be reached by hiking a round-trip distance of about 1.4 miles (2.3 km) along the trail.</p>`,

Cape Royal is also an especially great spot to watch the sunset as the canyon turns red.</p>
				<p>At Cape Royal you can also take in views from atop a natural arch, the <strong>Angels Window</strong>, which is one of the viewpoints along the 1.1 mile (1.8 km) round-trip trail to reach Cape Royal.

				<p>Cape Royal is located at the very end of Cape Royal Road. Along the way to Cape Royal are several excellent viewpoints, including the nearby <strong>Walhalla Overlook</strong>. Also nearby you might consider the 4 mile (6.4 km) round-trip hike to <strong>Cape Final</strong>, which travels through the forest before reaching the edge of the canyon, offering breathtaking views over a beautiful part of the Grand Canyon.
				<h3>Roosevelt Point Overlook</h3>
				<p>Be sure to stop at the <strong>Roosevelt Point Overlook</strong>, which offers a very interesting perspective where you can see the landscape change from the rugged and deep Grand Canyon to vast flat deserts beyond the canyon.
				<h3>Point Imperial</h3>
				<p>Also noteworthy is <strong>Point Imperial</strong>, which is located along Point Imperial Road (the northern fork in the road, with the south fork being Cape Royal Road). This viewpoint is similar to Roosevelt Point but offers a wider variety of scenery and more of the Grand Canyon.</p>`,

You can reach this picturesque geological feature via a 1.1 mile (1.8 km) round-trip trail from the parking lot, with the option of hiking along the rim to take in different views over the bend.</p>

				<p>Both canyons can only be accessed by tour as they are on Navajo land, but the tours are fairly priced and very informative. Just be sure to book your reservations in advanced as they fill up quickly and you don't want to be waiting for hours to see the canyon.</p>
				<p>If you wish to see the light beams of Upper Antelope Canyon be sure to book your tour during the right time of day when this incredible sight occurs, which costs slightly more. You can also pay more for a special photography tour of either canyon which is much less crowded. Both canyons are highly recommended.</p>`,

				<p>In Page be sure to look over the gigantic Glen Canyon Dam. You'll find the best views overlooking the dam from the <strong>Glen Canyon Dam Overlook</strong> to the southeast of the dam. You can also enjoy impressive views over Lake Powell from the dam and visit the Visitor Center, from which you can book a tour to see the inner-workings of the dam.</p>
				<p>The bottom of the Glen Canyon Dam is also the starting point for a special river rafting tour down the Colorado River that you can book. This tour takes you through Glen Canyon, passing through Horseshoe Bend, so you can see this incredible formatiion from below.</p>
				<h3>Wahweap Overlook</h3>
				<p>North of the Glen Canyon Dam you can drive up to the nearby <strong>Wahweap Overlook</strong>, which provides majestic views over Lake Powell and the many strange rock formations jutting out of this picturesque lake.</p>
				<h3>Rainbow Bridge National Monument</h3>
				<p>Another amazing tour you can take near Page is to the breathtaking <strong>Rainbow Bridge National Monument</strong>, which can only be accessed via scenic boat ride along Lake Powell followed by a round-trip walk of 1.8 miles (2.9 km) through a canyon.</p>`,

				body: `<h3>The Wave</h3>
				<p>If you're visiting Page you should try entering into the lottery to win a permit to hike the stunning <strong>Wave Trail</strong>, which is approximately 6.1 miles (9.8 km) round-trip and incredibly beautiful. Very few permits are given out daily to see this mesmerizing geological formation so winning is quite difficult, but it's definitely worth trying.</p>
				<p>The Wave is located southwest from the Toadstool Hoodoos. The Wave Trailhead can be found at Wire Pass near the border of Arizona and Utah.</p>
				<h3>Toadstool Hoodoos</h3>
				<p>Approximately 30 minutes west of Page you should consider hiking the 1.8 mile (2.9 km) round-trip <strong>Toadstool Hoodoos Trail</strong>. This trail journeys through a bizarre yet stunning landscape of mushroom-like hoodoo formations where the rock and canyons turn from white to red.</p>
				<h3>Alstrom Point</h3>
				<p>You might also consider driving to <strong>Alstrom Point</strong>, which is accessible via a difficult road that requires a 4x4 vehicle to reach and is quite far (approximately 40 miles/65 km one-way from Page), but rewards with gorgeous views overlooking Lake Powell from high above. The overlook is located on the northern side of Lake Powell, and the rough road leading to it can be reached from the town of Big Water.</p>`,

				<h3>Dolly Steamboat & Tortilla Flat</h3>

				<p>North of Sedona along Highway 89 is another great attraction, <strong>Slide Rock State Park</strong>, where Oak Creek forms long smooth natural water slides that you can slide down. This area is very beautiful and a popular place for lounging along the red rock as well as cliff jumping into the deeper parts of the creek.</p>
				<h3>West Fork Trail</h3>
				<p>Just north of Slide Rock State Park is the extremely popular <strong>West Fork Trail</strong>, which ventures into a heavily wooded red rock canyon alongside the serene west fork of Oak Creek. The total in and back length of this trail is about 7.2 miles, however you can make this hike shorter by turning around whenever you please. Overall the trail is relatively flat and easy-going.</p>`,

Technically this trail can be followed all the way to the bottom of the canyon and up to the other side, but be aware that even reaching the bottom of this vast canyon and the Colorado River is a multiple day hike.</p>
				<p>The best option is to hike the 6 mile (9.7 km) round-trip trail to the <strong>Three Mile Resthouse</strong>, which is literally located 3 miles (4.8 km) into the descent down the canyon, with a total elevation gain of approximately 2,100 feet (640 m).</p>`,

				<p>This hike is approximately 12.3 miles (19.8 km) round-trip with about 3,200 feet (980 m) of elevation gain. To reach the Colorado River it's about 19 miles (30.1 km) round-trip and nearly 1 mile (1.6 km) of elevation gain, with the Bright Angel Campground as your mid-point before heading back up the canyon.</p>`

				<p>During the winter you can drive to all of these viewpoints, however from March-November you can only access them via free shuttle, which starts from Grand Canyon Village.

				<p>You can hike this trail down to <strong>Ooh Aah Point</strong> (1.8 miles/2.9 km round-trip and 700 feet/200 meters of elevation gain), <strong>Cedar Ridge</strong> (3.1 miles/5 km round-trip and 1,200 feet/370 meters of elevation gain), or to <strong>Skeleton Point</strong> (5.6 miles/9 km round-trip and 2,000 feet/600 meters of elevation gain).</p>`,

				<p>Approximately 10 miles east of the Visitor Center is the first major viewpoint, <strong>Grandview Point</strong>, which is one of the most popular and stunning overlooks in the park. Continue along to another excellent viewpoint down the road, <strong>Moran Point</strong>. These two breathtaking viewpoints are located far apart from each other and are both very highly recommended.</p>
				<p>Afterwards you might like to stop at two more viewpoints overlooking the Grand Canyon, <strong>Lipan Point</strong> and nearby <strong>Navajo Point</strong>, which both offer slightly different perspectives.</p>`,
