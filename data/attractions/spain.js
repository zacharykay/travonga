				anchor: null,
				carousel_id: null,
				body: `<p>Spain's extremely scenic Costa Blanca (White Coast) is a popular vacation destination which features many gorgeous beaches and amazing attractions along a large stretch of coastline between Alicante an Valencia.</p><p>Popular beach resort towns to visit along the Costa Blanca (listed from south to north) include Alicante, Villajoyosa, Benidorm, L'Albir, Altea, Calp, Moraira, and Denia. All of these cities are connected to each other via an efficient tram system, making travel fairly easy without a car if you're willing to walk or take taxis.</p>`,
				hidden_content: null
			},
			{
				heading: 'Alicante, Spain',
				anchor: 'alicante',
				carousel_id: 'carousel_1',
				body: `<p>Towering over the coastal city of Alicante is the 9th century <strong>Santa Barbara Castle</strong>, a massive hilltop fortification surrounded by expansive medieval walls. This castle hosts a history museum and many corridors to explore. From the top of the castle you can enjoy majestic panoramic views over the scenic coastline. The easiest way to reach the castle is via the Ascensor al Castell elevator near the beach. Otherwise it's not a very long walk however its quite a steep ascent to the top.</p><p>Just below the castle is the sandy <strong>El Postiguet Beach</strong>, which features a long promenade and fantastic views looking up at the castle.</p>`,
				hidden_content: `<p>Also nearby the castle is the city's <strong>MARQ Archaeological Museum</strong>, which contains a significant collection of artifacts stretching back to prehistory and Ancient Rome. The museum contains many interactive exhibits and displays its artifacts in a very engaging manner. MARQ is also known for its collection of underwater artifacts, many of which were retrieved from shipwrecks.</p><p>In the center of Alicante is the city's impressive main plaza, the <strong>Plaza de los Luceros</strong>, which has an extravagant giant fountain at its center and is surrounded by palm trees and tall buildings.</p><h3>Banos de la Reina Ruins (El Campello, Spain)</h3><p>Further up the coast from Alicante are part of the remains of an ancient Roman village, <strong>Banos de la Reina El Campello</strong>, which sits on a tiny peninsula. You can walk amongst the ruins and then swim in the adjacent ancient fish farms if you like, which are carved into the rocks at the end of the peninsula.</p>`
			},
			{
				heading: 'Villajoyosa, Spain',
				anchor: 'villajoyosa',
				carousel_id: null,
				body: `<p>A bit north of Alicante is the picturesque town of <strong>Villajoysa</strong> (also known as La Vila Joiosa), which is best known for the vibrant colorful homes which line the boardwalk behind its beautiful sandy beach. This boardwalk is called the Paseo de Sant Pere and is very scenic, passing many great restaurants and bars along the beach.</p>`,
				hidden_content: null
			},
			{
				heading: 'Benidorm, Spain',
				anchor: 'benidorm',
				carousel_id: 'carousel_2',
				body: `<p>Further up the Costa Blanca is the popular resort and party town of Benidorm, where the beaches are lined with stunning tall high-rise buildings. The city's stunning <strong>Playa de Poniente</strong> beach features clear waters and amazing scenery, as well as a long colorful boardwalk lined with bars and restaurants.</p><p>Benidorm's most famous attraction is the <strong>Balcon del Mediterraneo</strong> (Mediterranean Balcony), a lavish and extremely photogenic large balcony along the cliffs. The balcony also offers incredible panoramic views over the city and coastline.</p><p>On the eastern side of the Balcon del Mediterraneo is another long sandy beach, the Playa de Llevant, which also hosts a boardwalk and many restaurants, bars, and nightlife.</p>`,
				hidden_content: `<h3>Hiking & Viewpoints</h3><p>If you'd like to enjoy views high above Benidorm and the coast you can drive or take a taxi up to <strong>La Creu Benidorm</strong>, a hilltop viewpoint offering breathtaking views over the city.</p><p>A long and strenuous but highly recommended hike is the trail along the crests of the cliffs between Benidorm and L'Albir, starting from the La Creu Benidorm Viewpoint and ending near the Camino del Faro trailhead. This route along the Sierra Helada is extremely scenic with breathtaking coastal views and very few people. The one-way hiking distance is roughly 6.5 miles (10.5km) to L'Albir, so you'll want to take a combination of taxis and the tram/bus to complete the loop.</p><p>A short drive or tram ride northeast from Benidorm is the picturesque <strong>Faro del Albir Lighthouse</strong>. In order to reach the lighthouse, you'll need to take a scenic 3.2 mile (5.2 km) round-trip hike along the Camino del Faro trail (from the trailhead), which is part of the Serra Gelada Natural Park. At the end of this nature trail you're rewarded with amazing views overlooking a gorgeous section of the Costa Blanca.</p>`
			},
			{
				heading: 'Altea, Spain',
				anchor: 'altea',
				carousel_id: null,
				body: `<p>About halfway between Benidorm and Calpe is the beautiful beach town of Altea, with an old hilltop village filled with extremely photogenic white homes and pathways to explore. This hilltop is centered around the <strong>Plaza de la Iglesia</strong> and offers many different viewpoints overlooking the coast and many excellent photo opportunities.</p>`,
				hidden_content: null
			},
			{
				heading: 'Guadalest Castle (Car Recommended)',
				anchor: 'guadalest',
				carousel_id: 'carousel_3',
				body: `<p>Towering above the village of Guadelst (inland from Benidorm) is the 11th century <strong>Castell de Guadalest</strong>, a hilltop castle complex. Within the complex are several interesting museums and lovely historic structures. From the castle you can also enjoy magnificent views over the nearby vivid turquoise reservoir, which sits below tall beautiful mountains.</p><p>In order to reach the castle without a car, you'll need to take two buses from Benidorm, which takes just under 1.5 hours, however the second bus (in the town of Callosa d'en Sarria) only travels to Guadalest twice a day, so you'll need to time out visiting this popular castle very precisely.</p><h3>Algar Waterfalls (Car Only)</h3>`,
				hidden_content: `<p>Also inland from Benidorm are the <strong>Algar Waterfalls</strong>, a series of waterfalls flowing through a canyon. A very short trail runs alongside the waterfalls and allows visitors to access the clear light blue waters of the river for swimming.</p>`
			},
			{
				heading: 'Calpe, Spain',
				anchor: 'calpe',
				carousel_id: null,
				body: `<p>Northeast along the coast from Benidorm is another great resort town, Calpe. At the eastern end of Calpe is a massive peninsular rock which sticks out from the coastline, known as <strong>Penyal d'Ifac</strong>. An excellent place to view the rock set amongst the shore is from the boardwalk at Calpe's Bano de la Reina, a mostly ruined ancient Roman site.</p><p>On the other side of the Penyal d'Ifac is the <strong>Playa de la Fossa Beach</strong> (just north of the rock) offering incredible views of the Penyal d'Ifac.</p><p>It's also possible to see the Penyal d'Ifac rock up close, or even climb to the top of the rock for stunning panoramic views over the coast. If you wish to reach the top of the rock, the round-trip hiking time is approximately 2+ hours and is very challenging.</p>`,
				hidden_content: `<p>The trail is actually quite dangerous and technical requiring significant scrambling, so be sure to bring shoes and water and take your time as most of the trail does not have rails after a certain point. Many people only hike up part-way to the long cave before turning around, which offers great views and is a less challenging trail than beyond the cave.</p><h3>Monte Toix Viewpoint (Car or Taxi Only)</h3><p>On the western side of Calpe you can take a short drive or taxi ride up to the top of a coastal ridge, Monte Toix, where you'll find a stunningly gorgeous viewpoint overlooking Calpe and the coastline. This viewpoint is the <strong>Mirador Monte Toix</strong> and is an excellent introduction to the city.</p>`
			},
			{
				heading: 'Moraira, Spain',
				anchor: 'moraira',
				carousel_id: 'carousel_4',
				body: `<p>Northeast from Calpe along the coast is the beach resort town of Moraira, which is known for its breathtaking <strong>Playa del Portet</strong> beach with its vibrant light blue waters and gorgeous scenery. Along the way to the beach you can walk along the lovely <strong>Miradores de Portitxolet Stairway</strong>, enjoying amazing views over the coast and Moraira's port.</p><p>Moraira also hosts two tiny castle-forts, one along the coast (Castillo de Moraira) and one high above the Playa de Portet (the Torre del Cap d'Or tower). The tower above the beach offers stunning views from atop the mountain it sits on and can be reached via a short but strenuous hike.</p>`,

				anchor: 'cala-moraig-beach',
				carousel_id: null,

Water shoes are recommended for the beach and sea cave.</p>`,
				hidden_content: `<h3>Hiking to Cala Moraig (from Moraira, Spain)</h3><p>It's possible to reach the Cala Moraig via a long but extremely scenic hike from the town of Moraira. This route begins in the neighborhoods north of Moraira Beach and follows along the Barranco de La Viuda trail throug a forested canyon. The trail leads to the stunning <strong>Cala Llebeig</strong> beach, which can only be reached via hiking.</p><p>From the Cala Llebeig Beach you can take an incredible cliffside hike along the Ruta de los Acantilados trail which features fantastic voastal views as well as ruins before connecting to the Cala Moraig beach. This route is approximately 5 miles (8 km) one-way from Downtown Moraira (near the port).</p>`

				carousel_id: null,
				body: `<p>Further up the coast from Calpe and Cala Moraig Beach near the city of Denia is a mesmerizing series of shallow sea caves, known as <strong>Cova Tallada</strong>. These giant caves are incredibly gorgeous and contain grottoes as well as sea arches and long deep caves you can explore and swim around.</p><p>You can access this sea cave via a moderate hike of about 2 miles (3.2 km) round-trip along the coast, beginning from the Mirador Las Rotas at the eastern edge of Denia. Water shoes are highly recommended for visiting the sea caves.</p>`,
				hidden_content: `<h3>Reaching Cova Tallada by Bus</h3><p>It's possible to reach the Cova Tallada sea caves without a car by taking the bus from Explanada de Cervantes (near the Port of Denia, Spain) all the way to its last stop at the Restaurante Mena near the trailhead.</p>`

This massive palace complex is the UNESCO listed Alhambra, which is among the top attractions in Spain.</p>`,

This complex consists of many ornate palaces, most notably the <strong>Palace of Charles V</strong> and the Nasrid Palace. The Alhambra's Nasrid Palace hosts the elegant <strong>Patio de los Leones</strong>, <strong>Myrtle Patio</strong>, and Patio de Comares. Other lovely patio courtyards can be found at the <strong>El Partal Palace</strong>.</p><p>The entire complex is surrounded by imposing medieval walls and also contains many beautiful fine gardens to explore, as well as the ruins of an <strong>Alcazaba</strong> fortress. Adjacent to the Alcazaba on the western edge of the complex is the <strong>Torre de la Vela</strong> tower, from which you can enjoy amazing panoramic views over Granada, high above the city.</p>`,

It's very easy to travel around the island without a car via public transportation.</p><p>The island's main city is also named Ibiza, which has become somewhat of a mecca for electronic music fans, featuring several of the top 100 dance clubs in the world. Ibiza is a world famous party and nightlife destination, and even a UNESCO world heritage site with its beautiful coastline and beaches.</p>`,

				body: `<p>The <strong>Aqueduct of Segovia</strong> was constructed during the 1st century by the Ancient Romans and is among the best-preserved Roman aqueducts in the world, along with the Pont du Gard of Southern France. Unlike the Pont du Gard, this breathtaking aqueduct runs directly through a city, connecting to the southern entrance of Segovia's historic center.</p><p>You can walk along part of Segovia's walls and enjoy views of the aqueduct adjacent to where the aqueduct meets the walls, at the <strong>Mirador Aqueduct</strong>.</p>`,

				body: `<p>On the other end of the city's historic center is the <strong>Alcazar de Segovia</strong>, a fairytale-like castle which literally inspired Disney's Cinderella Castle. Within the castle you can admire its historic medieval interiors and intricate halls.</p><p>Just outside of Segovia's historic center are two amazing viewpoints of the castle. The closer viewpoint is the <strong>Mirador de la Pradera de San Marcos</strong>, which you can reach via a steep pathway which begins near the castle.</p>`,
				hidden_content: `<h3>Hiking Instructions for Castle Viewpoints</h3><p>The path to the viewpoint is downhill and leads to another part of town, nearby which is a large open grassy field from which you can admire picturesque views of the castle. From here you can walk along the Paseo del Eresma pathway next to the Eresma River before crossing a bridge and following a stream which flows below/around the Old Town, walking through a small scenic forest with impressive ruins before circling to the other side of town where you can re-enter at the fortified city at the Puerta de San Andres Gate.</p><p>The total length of this incredible trail which offers different perspectives of Segovia and the castle is approximately 1.4 miles (2.2 km), starting from the castle.</p><p>You can add a steep 0.5 mile (0.8 km) round-trip detour to the trail below the castle to reach the lesser-known viewpoint, the <strong>Mirador del Alcazar y los dos Valles</strong>. This amazing viewpoint sits at eye-level with the castle and also provides views of Segovia's cathedral behind the castle. You can even further your detour to the nearby Mirador del Ultimo Pino for even better views of the castle and cathedral.</p>`

				hidden_content: `<p>Just north of the walled historic center of Segovia near the castle is another interesting attraction, the Museo Real Casa de Moneda de Segovia (or <strong>Royal Mint House of Coins</strong>). The 16th century Royal Mint House was the first mechanized coin-producing factory in Spain and is among the oldest industrial buildings in Europe. The mint now serves as a museum showcasing old industrial processes.</p><p>You can access the Royal Mint House via the same path you would take from the castle to reach the first viewpoint below the castle, the Mirador de la Pradera de San Marcos.</p>`

The old town of Toledo is located within this river bend and is surrounded by impressive fortified walls. You'll find a majority of the city's attractions and many charming rustic structures within the old walled town.</p><p>Toledo is located just southwest of Madrid, which is directly connected to Toledo via a short train ride.</p>`,

	<p>An even more exciting way to cross the Taugus River is to zipline over it at the extremely popular Fly Toledo, which travels alongside the bridge.</p>`,

This scenic riverside route between the San Martin's Bridge and Alcantara Bridge is approximately 1.8 miles (2.9 km) one-way.</p><h3>Mirador del Valle City Overlook</h3><p>A must-see attraction in Toledo is the <strong>Mirador del Valle</strong> viewpoint, which provides the iconic views overlooking Toledo from behind the river featured in many postcards. This viewpoint can be easily reached if you have a car, otherwise it's a 1.1 mile each way hike from the Alcantara Bridge.</p>`,

You can also enjoy amazing views of the castle from the beach.</p><h3>Reaching Peñiscola Castle</h3><p>By car the city and caslte of Peñiscola is about 1.5 hours from Valencia.
