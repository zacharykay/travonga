				body: `<p>Glacier National Park is located along the remote Rocky Mountains of Northern Montana, just south of the Canadian border. Within the park you'll find vast forests, towering mountains, beautiful glacial lakes, and many glaciers. The park also hosts an incredible diversity and abundance of wild animals and is an excellent place for wildlife viewing.</p><p>One of the best ways to see Glacier National Park is to drive along the extremely scenic Going to the Sun Road, which winds its way through the park for 50 miles (80 km) from the town of West Glacier to St. Mary, with many of the trailheads for the parks most popular hikes along the way.</p>`,

			{
				heading: 'Avalanche Lake',
				anchor: 'avalanche-lake',
				carousel_id: 'carousel_1',
				body: `<p>At the very southern end of Going to the Sun Road is the giant deep blue <strong>Lake McDonald</strong>, which the road flows alongside with many viewpoints over the lake.</p><p>North of Lake McDonald is the park's most popular moderate hike, the 5.7 mile (9.2 km) round-trip route combining the Trail of the Cedars Nature Trail with Avalanche Lake Trail. This hike concludes at the breathtaking glacial <strong>Avalanche Lake</strong>, which is surrounded by majestic mountains. The <strong>Trail of the Cedars</strong> by itself is an easy 0.9 miles (1.4 km) round-trip hike which is popular for short walks.</p>`,
				hidden_content: null
			},
			{
				heading: 'Hidden Lake',
				anchor: 'hidden-lake',
				carousel_id: 'carousel_2',
				body: `<p>Further along the road is the Logan Pass Visitor Center, where you'll find the trailhead for another popular moderate hike, the 4.9 mile (7.9 km) <strong>Hidden Lake Trail</strong> which ventures past beautiful meadows before arriving at the magnificent Hidden Lake, with an elevation gain of about 1,400 feet (420 m).</p><p>Alternatively you might take the easier 2.8 mile (4.5 km) round-trip route part of the way along the trail to the <strong>Hidden Lake Overlook</strong>, which hosts the best views over the lake. This option has a much smaller elevation gain as well.</p>`,
				hidden_content: null
			},
			{
				heading: 'The Garden Wall & Highline Trail',
				anchor: 'garden-wall',
				carousel_id: null,
				body: `<p>From the Logan Pass Visitor Center you might like to hike the much more challenging 14.7 mile (23.7 km) round-trip route to the <strong>Garden Wall</strong>, via the Highline Trail. Along this amazing hike through nature you also have a very high chance of encountering wild mountain goats.</p><p>This hike has a relatively steady elevation gain of about 3,500 feet (1,070 m) passing through lush forests and meadows, before arriving at the absolutely breathtaking Garden Wall viewpoint. This viewpoint overlooks the Grinnell Glacier from behind, as well as a heavenly valley of glacial lakes and forests surrounded by sheer mountains below the glacier, called the Many Lakes Area.</p>`,

			{
				heading: 'St. Mary, Montana',
				anchor: 'st-mary-area',
				carousel_id: 'carousel_3',
				body: `<h3>St. Mary Falls & Virginia Falls</h3><p>Further along the Going to the Sun Road is a relatively easy and very scenic hike, the 2.9 mile (4.7 km) round-trip trail which includes <strong>St. Mary Falls</strong> and <strong>Virginia Falls</strong>, one of the park's most popular easy hikes.</p><p>Close-by these waterfalls be sure to stop for amazing views overlooking Saint Mary Lake from <strong>Sun Point</strong>. The scenic road ends in the town of St. Mary just after the lake, however the park has much more to offer.</p><h3>Two Medicine Lake</h3><p>Be sure to drive south of St. Mary to the South Shore Trailhead, from which you can take in picturesque views of <strong>Two Medicine Lake</strong> and the mountains behind it. Nearby this lake you might like to take the short 0.6 mile (1 km) round-trip trail to see the beautiful <strong>Running Eagle Falls</strong>.</p>`,
				hidden_content: null
			},
			{
				heading: 'Swiftcurrent Lake',
				anchor: 'swiftcurrent-lake',
				carousel_id: 'carousel_4',
				body: `<p>Northeast of St. Mary in the Swiftcurrent area of the park, which features many more excellent hiking opportunities. Be sure to take in the gorgeous views over <strong>Swiftcurrent Lake</strong> from the Many Glacier Hotel. Two of the park's most popular moderate trails can be found near Swiftcurrent as well, the Iceberg Lake Trail and the Grinnel Glacier Trail, both of which are highly recommended.</p><h3>Apikuni Falls</h3><p>One of the easiest hikes in the Swiftcurrent area is the 1.8 mile (2.9 km) round-trip trail to <strong>Apikuni Falls</strong>, a stunning multi-level waterfall.</p>`,
				hidden_content: null
			},
			{
				heading: 'Grinnell Glacier',
				anchor: 'grinnell-glacier',
				carousel_id: null,
				body: `<p>Located in the Swiftcurrent Lake area, the <strong>Grinnell Glacier Trail</strong> is approximately 9.7 miles (15.6 km) round-trip with an elevation gain of about 2,000 feet (600 m). This amazing route travels through the forest past two serene lakes before climbing up above Grinnell Lake to the base of the Grinnell Glacier, which sits jut below the Garden Wall.</p>`,
				hidden_content: null

			{
				heading: 'Iceberg Lake',
				anchor: 'iceberg-lake',

				body: `<p>Also located in the Swiftcurrent Lake area, the <strong>Iceberg Lake Trail</strong> is approximately 9.3 miles (15 km) round-trip with an elevation gain of nearly 1,450 feet (440 m). This trail travels deep into a majestic valley of forests and meadows, before arriving at the tranquil Iceberg Lake, which is named for the seasonal ice that floats on the lake below the towering cliffs that surround it.</p>`,
				hidden_content: null
			},
			{
				heading: 'Swiftcurrent Mountain',
				anchor: 'swiftcurrent-mountain',
				carousel_id: 'carousel_5',
				body: `<p>One of Glacier National Park's most incredible longer-distance trails is the Swiftcurrent Pass Trail. This path travels through a lush valley from Swiftcurrent, passing along the striking <strong>Redrock Falls</strong> (a rare waterfall that flows over red rock), followed by the pristine Bullhead Lake, before ascending up the valley to <strong>Swiftcurrent Mountain</strong>. From the top of the mountain you're rewarded with incredibly gorgeous views overlooking this picturesque valley.</p><p>The trail to reach Swiftcurrent Mountain is very challenging at about 15.9 miles (25.6 km) round-trip with an elevation gain of approximately 3,800 feet (1,150 m).</p><h3>Garden Wall Add-on Hiking Option</h3><p>If you'd like, you can continue to the magnificent Garden Wall viewpoint which overlooks another stunning valley of lakes and forests, with a total round-trip hiking distance of about 20.5 miles (33 km). In between Swiftcurrent Mountain and the Garden Wall is the Granite Park Chalet, a lodge which also offers food.</p>`,

This trail has an elevation gain of approximately 1,700 feet (500 m).</p>`,
