Apart from its massive size, the Cologne Cathedral is famous for its strikingly intricate Gothic architecture and design, earning it the status as a UNESCO world heritage site. Be sure to take a tour of the cathedral and enjoy the views overlooking Cologne from atop its tower.</p><h3>Alter Markt (Old Market Square)</h3><p>A short walk away from Cologne’s Cathedral is the city’s <strong>Alter Markt</strong> (Old Market) square line with colorful old buildings, including the oldest city hall building in Germany, Rathaus Koln. Cologne’s Alter Markt also hosts a famous Christmas Market and is surrounded by many shops and restaurants.</p><p>Towering above the Old Market square is the stunning castle-like <strong>Great St. Martin Church</strong>, a 1,000 year old Romanesque-style church.</p><h3>Museums</h3><p>Just across from the Cologne Cathedral is the <strong>Museum Ludwig</strong>, an eccentric ultramodern structure containing important collections of modern art, including works by Andy Warhol and one of the most sizable collections of Picasso’s works in Europe. Adjacent to this museum is the Roman-Germanic Museum which houses an impressive collection of ancient Roman artifacts originating from the ancient city on which Cologne was built on top of.</p><p>On a small island along the Rhine River south of the Cologne Cathedral is the extremely popular Cologne Chocolate Museum with exhibits detailing the history of chocolate, beginning in Mesoamerican civilizations. Unsurprisingly, this museum also sells some incredibly good-tasting chocolate.</p><p>The Cologne Chocolate Museum is located at the tip of an island along the Rheinauhafen waterfront promenade, which also hosts an Olympic Museum, and the stunning ultramodern <strong>Kranhaus</strong> (Crane House) buildings.</p>",

Bonn Minster is known for its massive spired-topped towers and displays beautiful Romanesque architecture.</p><h3>Beethoven-Haus Museum</h3><p>Interestingly, Bonn was the birthplace of the famous composer Beethoven, and his early childhood home is now a museum, called the <strong>Beethoven-Haus</strong>. This museum is the only preserved home of the Beethoven family, and contains the largest collection of items related to Ludwig van Beethoven in the world.</p>",

Additionally, the cathedral hosts many strikingly complex and ornate mosaics amongst its decadent interiors.

From Füssen it’s a very short bus ride of about 10 minutes to reach the castles of Hohenschwangau.</p><h3>Pre-Book Your Tickets</h3><p>Due to its extreme popularity, it’s highly recommended to purchase your tickets to Neuschwanstein Castle in advance, in order to avoid waiting in long lines to purchase tickets.  Because the castles are only open to visit as part of a guided tour, visitors must choose time slots, and if you wait until you arrive to book a tour, you might get a much later tour time, or the tours may even be completely sold out.</p>",

Despite being founded during ancient Roman times, you’ll find most of the buildings in Central Füssen to be of beautiful medieval architecture. In Füssen’s city center you’ll find many hotels, restaurants, cafes, and shops.</p><p>Füssen is even home to its own small castle, <strong>Hohes Schloss</strong>, or the High Castle of Füssen. Within this charming gothic castle you can admire a Bavarian State collection of Gothic and Renaissance fine art.</p><p>Perhaps the most beautiful attraction in Füssen is the Benedictine Monastery / <strong>Abbey of St. Mang</strong>, which was built in the 9th century. The St. Mang’s Abbey houses strikingly elegant baroque interiors, as well as a history and violin museum, and a medieval crypt which contains the oldest fresco in Germany.</p><h3>Lechfall Waterfall</h3><p>The most picturesque views of the St. Mang’s Abbey can be seen from just across the bridge along the Lech River, which flows through Füssen. From this viewpoint, you can walk west for about 10 minutes to reach a small but beautiful <strong>Lechfall Waterfall</strong> along the Lech River.</p><p>The best viewpoints of Lechfall can be admired from the the Maxsteg bridge which spans across the river just below the waterfall. Also impressive is the view over the small <strong>Lechfall Gorge</strong> seen from the other side of the bridge.</p>",

This gorgeous lake is surrounded by hills covered in lush dense forests, making it quite breathtaking. You can even rent a paddleboat to enjoy this scenic lake if you like. There’s also an array of hiking trails which encircle the lake and travel up into the hills and mountains above Alpsee.</p><p>Apart from a few restaurants and hotels, Hohenschwangau also hosts the <strong>Museum of the Bavarian Kings</strong>. Inside this museum you can learn more about the Bavarian King Ludwig II and his father King Maximillian II before touring inside their castles. This museum is attached to a charming and photogenic medieval hotel, called the <strong>Hotel Alpenrose</strong>, which sits along the shore of Alpsee.</p>",

In comparison with Neuschwanstein, the Hohenschwangau Castle is much more modest, however it is still a very impressive castle which you must book a tour for, either ahead of time or at the nearby ticketing office if you wish to see inside it.</p><p>Within the Hohenschwangau Castle are many well-preserved original rooms with highly ornate decorations and historic furnishings. Among the highlights within this castle are the medieval-style murals and the huge oversized pool table.</p>",

Neuschwanstein Castle is so beautiful that it is even the castle that inspired Walt Disney’s Cinderella Castle.</p><p>In order to reach the Neuschwanstein Castle, you’ll need to hike up a hill (or take a short but crowded tram ride), since the fairytale-like castle is built on a hilltop above Hohenschwangau surrounded by dense forests. You can only visit inside Neuschwanstein Castle via a guided tour, for which there is limited availability, so be sure to book your ticket ahead of time.</p><h3>Castle Interior</h3><p>Inside the Neuschwanstein Castle are some of the most incredible rooms of any castle in the world. Although the castle was built in the 19th century, no expense was spared in recreating the interior of an idyllic medieval castle with extremely intricate details in every room, and meticulously crafted handmade furnishings.</p><p>This castle is truly the height of medieval-inspired opulence, especially its extravagantly decorated Throne Hall room, and its stunning grotto, a highly-realistic artificial cave with a large pool, located in the middle of the castle.</p><p>The only downside to visiting Neuschwanstein Castle is that no photos are allowed inside, but you wouldn’t have time for pictures anyways as you marveled at the incredibly fine details in every room. After your tour you can step out onto the terrace, where you are allowed to take photos of the picturesque Alpsee lake beneath the hills, framed behind the stone columns of the balcony terrace.</p>",

Just below the castle is the <strong>Skywalk Neuschwanstein</strong>, providing close-up views of the castle.</p><p>Continue up to the <strong>Panoramablick Schwangau</strong> to admire the backside of the castle rising up out of the forest. This viewpoint is next to the <strong>Hohenschwangau Viewpoint</strong>, which is named for its amazing views overlooking the Hohenschwangau Castle rising above the village below.</p><h3>Marienbrücke Bridge</h3><p>A bit further up the mountain is the <strong>Marienbrücke Bridge</strong>, which spans over a gorge and the beautiful <strong>Pöllat Waterfall</strong>. From this bridge you can enjoy the most iconic view of Neuschwanstein Castle, with its long side rising up above the forests, framed against the rural landscape behind it.</p><h3>Mountain Views</h3><p>Continue even further up the mountain to the <strong>Neuschwanstein Viewpoint</strong>, from which you can admire the Marienbrücke bridge with the castle seen behind it. This viewpoint is only about 12 minutes up the mountain from Neuschwanstein, and beyond this are many more hiking trails providing alternate viewpoints and different perspectives overlooking the castle.</p>",

The distance from the station atop Tegelberg to the Marienbrücke bridge viewpoint is about 2.5 miles (4.1 km).</p><p>Along the cable car ride up to Tegelberg you can enjoy incredibly beautiful views overlooking both Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau Castles rising above the forests and Alpsee Lake, a highly photogenic sight requiring a zoom for good photos.</p><p>From Tegelberg you can even walk along the ridges to other nearby mountains, the most popular short distance hike being to <strong>Branderschrofen Peak</strong>, which is about 1.2 miles (2 km) round-trip from Tegelberg Station. Branderschrofen Peak offers breathtaking panoramic views over the neighboring mountains and the valley below.</p>",

This fairytale-like medieval castle was built in the 12th century up in the hills above the river and is surrounded by dense forests. Be aware that the castle is only open to visitors from April through October.</p><p>The Eltz Castle’s exterior is especially photogenic, mixing half-timbered framing with fantastical stone towers and spired roofs. A long stone pathway atop a ridge leads to the castle’s entrance, and once inside you’ll find lavish medieval furnishings and decor. The castle also contains an armory and treasury filled with precious objects and artifacts as well as historic weaponry.</p><h3>Reaching Eltz Castle</h3><p>The easiest way to reach the Eltz Castle is via car or a tour from Koblenz/Cologne, however you can also reach it by bus on weekends and holidays. From Koblenz HBF Central Station you can take the train for just under 30 minutes to the village of Treis-Karden. From the village you can catch the VRM Line 330 (BurgenBus) to Eltz Castle, which runs 4 times per day [<a href=“https://www.vrminfo.de/fileadmin/data/pdf/fahrplanbuecher/2020/330.pdf” >Timetables</a>].</p><p>Apart from the bus, you can also reach the Eltz Castle via a moderately long hike of approximately 6.8 miles (11 km) round-trip from the Treis-Karden Train Station.</p>",

Cochem’s <strong>Marktplatz</strong> (Market Square) is highly photogenic and beautiful, featuring many half-timbered medieval buildings which house many cafes and restaurants. Nearby you might visit a unique museum dedicated to the history of mustard, the Historische Senfmühle Dehren GmbH, which also offers mustard tastings.</p><p>You might also consider hiking or taking the Cochemer Sesselbahn cable car up the mountain to the Pinnerkreuz Viewpoint, which offers majestic views overlooking Cochem and the Mosel River. Further up the mountain is a wildlife and amusement park called the Wild- und Freizeitpark Klotten.</p><h3>Cochem Castle</h3><p>Atop a hill on the southern side of town is Cochem’s top attraction, the <strong>Reichsburg Cochem Castle</strong>. This stunning 12th century castle sits above the river and features mesmerizing Neo-Gothic Romanticist architecture. Inside the castle you’ll find historic furnishings from the Middle Ages. The Cochem Castle also hosts medieval performances and reenactments amongst its charming grounds.</p><h3>Reaching Cochem</h3><p>From Koblenz HBF Train Station you can reach the town of Cochem in about 35 minutes by train. From Treis-Karden (the village near Eltz Castle) you can reach Cochem in just 10 minutes via train. It’s also possible to reach Cochem via ferry from Koblenz, although this option is obviously slower.</p>",

This area is dotted with many small medieval castles atop the hills, as well as many lovely towns and villages along the banks of the river. The Rhine River Valley begins at Koblenz and ends near the towns of Rüdesheim and Bingen, however the river continues much much further.</p><h3>Transportation</h3>",

With more time, it’s possible to visit many of the castles, towns, and other attractions along the Rhine River Valley without a car.</p><p>A convenient ferry system operated by KD Rhine runs along an even larger section of the Rhine River between the cities of Cologne, Koblenz, and Mainz, with many stops including Bonn, Konigswinter, Braubach, Bacharach, St. Goar, Kaub, Bingen, Rüdesheim, and many more. Trains also run along both sides of the Rhine River Valley with many stations along the way including in towns that the ferry does not stop in.</p>"

This 13th century castle sits atop a hill high above town and is one of the most visible castles along the Rhine River Valley.</p><p>In order to reach the Marksburg Castle and take a tour, you’ll need to hike up a steep hill from town.

Both towns can be reached from other towns along the Rhine via train or ferry, and a ferry also connects the two towns together.</p><h3>Burg Rheinfels Castle</h3><p>On the hilltop above St. Goar are the ruins of the <strong>Burg Rheinfels Castle</strong>, mostly consisting of the walls and shell leftover from the original 13th century structure. Despite its dilapidated state, the Rheinfels Castle is still quite impressive and offers fantastic views overlooking the Rhine River.</p><p>Interestingly, a portion of the castle was restored and now serves as a luxury hotel. The castle also hosts a small museum, a large cellar, and a system of underground tunnels that you can explore.</p><h3>Burg Katz Castle</h3><p>On the hilltop above St. Goarshausen is perhaps the most majestic castle along the Rhine River Valley, <strong>Burg Katz Castle</strong>. Interestingly, Katz Castle was originally built in the 14th century but later rebuilt after being destroyed by Napoleon.</p><p>Unfortunately Katz Castle is privately owned and not open to visitors, however the incredibly picturesque view looking up at the castle from the town below or from along the Rhine River should satisfy most would-be visitors.</p><h3>Burg Maus Castle</h3><p>Just north of Sankt Goarshausen is the impressive hilltop <strong>Burg Maus Castle</strong>, which is unfortunately also closed to the general public, and best admired when taking a boat ride along the Rhine River below.</p><h3>Loreley Rock</h3><p>The most famous and beautiful natural formation along the Rhine River is certainly <strong>Loreley Rock</strong>, a massive slate rock with sheer cliffs that towers over 430 feet (130 m) above the Rhine River. Loreley Rock is located just south of Sankt Goarshausen and is best admired from a boat along the river or from across the river.</p><p>If you have a vehicle or are willing to do a long hike, you can enjoy even better views overlooking Loreley Rock from the Loreley Observation Park in the hilltop town of Urbar, across the river from this stunning natural formation.</p>",

Among the most impressive of these towers that you might consider seeing are Kuhhirtenturm, <strong>Ochsenturm</strong>, <strong>Haagsturm</strong>, and Steingassenturm. A large portion of Oberwesel’s <strong>Medieval Walls</strong> are also topped with a walkway for tourists to explore along.</p><h3>Schönburg Castle</h3><p>On the hilltop above Oberwesel is one of the most beautiful castles along the Rhine River Valley, the 12th century <strong>Schönburg Castle</strong>, which is said to be the most romantic castle along the Rhine Valley.

This small but well-fortified castle was built in order to collect tolls from ships passing by it along the Rhine River.</p><p>In medieval times before the Rhine River was altered, ships would have to pass between a small channel in the river between Kaub’s Pfalzgrafenstein Castle and Gutenfels Castle.

From town near the train station you can take a scenic hike up the hillside to reach Stahleck Castle, passing several impressive medieval towers, including Hutturm, Sonneturm, Halbrundturm, and more.</p> <h3>Medieval Towers & Ruins</h3><p>Along the other hill above Bacharach to the north of the castle are several more amazing medieval structures, including the remains of part of an old chapel called <strong>Ruine Wernerkapelle</strong> and the <strong>Steeger Tor Tower</strong>. Nearby is the medieval <strong>Postenturm Tower</strong>, from which you can admire the iconic view overlooking Bacharach.</p><h3>Half-Timbered Buildings</h3><p>Other top sights in Bacharach include the lovely <strong>St. Peter’s Church</strong>, the medieval half-timbered <strong>Altes Haus</strong> (Old House), and the Posthof (Old Postal Station) with its arched walkway below a half-timbered tower.

This imposing but beautiful castle is surrounded by forests and requires a hike up the hill to reach. To reach the Rheinstein Castle without a car, you’ll need to walk approximately 1.4 miles (2.2 km) each way from the train station in Trechtingshausen.</p><p>Rheinstein Castle was built in the 14th century, but today it serves as a museum with incredible historic rooms and architectural features that have been well-preserved.

In this area you’ll find many restaurants and shops in a fairytale-like village setting.</p><p>Consider visiting Rüdesheim’s popular <strong>Siegried’s Mechanical Museum</strong>, which is housed within a beautiful half-timbered building and contains a collection of historic self-playing musical instruments.</p><h3>Ehrenfels Castle</h3><p>At the western edge of Rüdesheim are the ruins of the <strong>Burg Ehrenfels Castle</strong>, an imposing 12th century fortification that sits directly across the river from the Mouse Tower. This 12th century castle actually worked in conjunction with the Mouse Tower to collect tolls from passing ships along the Rhine River.</p><p>You can enjoy views overlooking Bingen from the road near the Ehrenfels Castle. Nearby you can hike up the hill to the medieval <strong>Rossel Tower</strong> for incredible views overlooking Bingen and the Nahe River.</p><h3>Niederwalddenkmal</h3><p>On a hilltop above Rüdesheim is the extremely popular <strong>Niederwalddenkmal Monument</strong>, which was built to commemorate the unification of Germany in the late 19th century. You can reach this hilltop monument by taking a scenic ride on a gondola chairlift up the hill from Rüdesheim, which passes above lovely hillside vineyards.</p><p>From the hilltop you can also enjoy amazing views overlooking the Rhine River below, especially from the small <strong>Niederwalddenkmal Temple</strong>. The chairlift station is called the <strong>Rüdesheimer Seilbahngesellschaft</strong> and is located next to the Old Town.</p>",

This magnificent Romanesque-Gothic-Baroque style cathedral was originally built 1,000 years ago but was badly damaged in WWII. This led to its modern reconstruction resulting in the new-looking castle-like appearance of the Mainz Cathedral today. You can reach the Mainz Cathedral with a walk of about 30 minutes from the city’s main train station.</p><h3>Marktplatz</h3><p>The Mainz Cathedral towers above the <strong>Marktplatz</strong> market square of Mainz’s Altstadt (Old Town), which is lined with many elegant historic buildings. The Marktplatz market square of Mainz hosts many public markets and a popular Christmas Market.</p><h3>Gutenberg Museum</h3><p>Behind Marktplatz you can visit the <strong>Gutenberg Museum</strong>, one of the oldest printing museums in the world. The Gutenberg Museum of Mainz hosts two of the extremely rare Gutenberg Bibles, as well as replicas of the Gutenberg printing press and Gutenberg’s workshop. Additionally the museum hosts many important historic bookplates used to print books, along with many other items related to printing.</p>",
