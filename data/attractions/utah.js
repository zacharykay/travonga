The Balanced Rock is one of the most iconic sights of Arches National Park despite not even being an arch. Be sure to walk around for different perspectives of this delicate natural formation, which will surely fall someday.</p>",

The trail to reach this unbelievable massive arch is only 0.5 miles (0.8 km) round-trip. Along this hike you can admire the stunning <strong>Parade of Elephants</strong> formation.</p>",

Additionally the arch may collapse in the near future, due to erosion and its truly delicate nature, so see it up-close while it still stands.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>If you hike up to the Delicate Arch, it's highly recommended do so around sunset, to witness the the beautiful red and orange shades that light up the arch. Ideally you'd want to arrive at the arch one hour before sunset, and then sit down and relax while watching the amazing spectacle.</p>",

This walk is surprisingly difficult in shoes however, as the trail consists of fine deep sand, so you might want to do this walk barefoot.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Before reaching the Devil's Garden at the end of the road, you might want to take a very short 0.4 mile (0.6 km) round-trip walk to see the <strong>Skyline Arch</strong>.

Along the approximately 2.3 mile (3.7 km) round-trip trail to the Landscape Arch you can take short detours to see several more impressive arches, including Tunnel Arch and Pine Tree Arch.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>You can extend this to a hike of approximately 4.5 miles (6.8 km) round-trip to see the mesmerizing <strong>Double O Arch</strong> much further into the Devils Garden, and another 0.8 miles (1.3 km) round-trip to get up-close to the striking <strong>Dark Angel</strong> formation. You can actually admire the Dark Angel from afar before descending down to the Double O Arch if you don't wish to hike any further.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Another popular option is to do hike the entire Devil's Garden Loop, which descends down into a scenic and much more remote area with additional arches, such as Private Arch, Black Cave Arch, and more. This entire route is approximately 7.8 miles (12.6) round-trip, and is quite challenging with a significant elevation gain over 1,000 feet (300 m) in an already high-elevation environment. Despite the difficulties, this route is quite amazing and provides much privacy, as very few people choose to do this hike.</p>",

Be sure to walk underneath the arch to view it from the other side, from which you can admire the arch's most photogenic angle.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The hike to the Corona Arch is also quite scenic and interesting, even passing by over an old railroad track carved into a canyon.</p>",

Due to its extreme remoteness, the Needles Overlook offers far-reaching and breathtaking views overlooking a vast and complex network of canyons, located within the Needles District of Canyonlands National Park.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>From the Needles Overlook you can truly appreciate the grandness and scale of the many winding canyons created by the Colorado River, which stretch on for miles and miles.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The detour from the highway to visit the Needles Overlook requires about 70 extra minutes of driving. If you're visiting Moab from the north, you should visit this overlook later when you're heading south to your next destination, as it's even located quite far from Moab.</p>",

The longer tours (2-3 hours) include all of these sights, with the longest adding more time for exploring at photos at each stop.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Another way to experience the majestic beauty of Monument Valley is via guided horseback tour around the mesas, along trails reserved for horseback only.

A bit further north is Utah's Natural bridges State Park.

You can tour through this national momnuemnt along a loop road, along which you can stop to see the three natural bridges along with various viewpoints over the canyon in which the bridges all span above.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Sipapu Bridge</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The first bridge you'll encounter is perhaps the most beautiful, the <strong>Sipapu Bridge</strong>. To properly view this bridge by standing below it, you'll need to hike about 1.3 miles (2.1 km) round-trip with quite a bit of elevation gain (along the way back out the canyon).</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Three Bridges Trail</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<p>If you'd like to see all of the bridges via a single hike, you can continue west from the Sipapu Bridge along the canyon floor, before exiting the canyon at the Kachina Bridge. From the Kachina Bridge you would return to your starting point via the Mesa Trail, which is relatively flat and easy after exiting the canyon. The entire length of this route is about 5.9 miles (9.5 km) round-trip.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Kachina Bridge</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The second bridge you'll encounter along the road is the <strong>Kachina Bridge</strong>, which is the least recommended of the three bridges. You can enjoy descent views of the bridge from above at the overlook, or descend into the canyon again via a 1.4 mile (2.3 km) round-trip trail. This bridge is worth the effort if you have plenty of time and energy to spare.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Owachomo Bridge</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The last bridge along the road, the <strong>Owachomo Bridge</strong>, is relatively easy to hike down to, as it is located in a more shallow part of the canyon. The Owachomo Bridge is quite wide and flat, giving it an interesting look. The hike to reach this bridge is about 0.8 miles (1.3 km) round-trip.</p>",
