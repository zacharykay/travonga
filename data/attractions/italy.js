				"body": "<p>Italy’s Amalfi Coast region is a UNSECO world heritage site and one of the most beautiful coastlines in the world. The Amalfi Coast is located along a mountainous coastline to the southeast of Naples and Pompeii. The Amalfi Coast is known for its many picturesque old villages and towns along the coast which sit below tall mountains with beautiful beaches.</p>\n        <p>Many of the towns of the Amalfi Coast have been inhabited since the Middle Ages and host many with colorful and rustic old homes. Places often combined with a visit to the Amalfi Coast are the seaside town of Sorrento and the ancient Greek archaeological site of Paestum.</p>\n        <h3>Transportation</h3>\n        <p>Due to the extremely rugged mountainous terrain of the Amalfi Coast, the only train station in the region is located just east of the Amalfi Coast in the town of Vietri Sul Mare, a suburb of Salerno and the eastern most town of the Amalfi Coast. Salerno has frequent direct train connections with Naples, which is well-connected to the rest of Italy via train and with its international airport.</p>",
				"hidden_content": "<p>The towns and villages of the Amalfi Coast are well-connected via bus, and you can take the ferries between several of the larger towns, including Amalfi, Positano, Maiori, Cetara, and Minori. All of these towns also connect to the nearby island of Capri via ferry.</p>\n            <p>It’s also possible to drive along the Amalfi Coast with a car, which allows you access to many more viewpoints and beaches. The downside of driving along the Amalfi Coast is that you’ll be drive along a two-lane highway which is often congested, competing for a very limited amount of parking spaces.</p>"

				"body": "<p>Along the southern side of the Bay of Naples on the other side of the mountains from the Amalfi coast is the city of Sorrento, which is not part of the Amalfi Coast region but is still very beautiful. You can reach Sorrento directly by train or ferry from Naples, and take the bus about 1 hour around the coast to reach the westernmost city of the Amalfi Coast, Positano.</p>\n        <p>Sorrento’s most picturesque site is certainly the <strong>Marina Piccola</strong> waterfront, which sits below vertical cliffs atop which the city is built. You can walk along the walls of the Port of Sorrento to admire the amazing views looking back at the Marina Piccola. You can also enjoy breathtaking views overlooking the Marina Piccola from above along the clifftop <strong>Villa Comunale Park</strong>, with views reaching to Mt. Vesuvius on a clear day.</p>\n        <p>On the western side of Sorrento is another marina, the scenic Marina Grande, which is lined with colorful houses along a small beach below the cliffs. This marina is also quite photogenic, especially when viewed from the ends of the harbor walls.</p>",
				"hidden_content": "<p>Set back from the coast is the lovely 14th century <strong>Sorrento Cathedral</strong>, with its simple Romanesque stone exterior. Inside the Sorrento Cathedral is lavishly decorated with beautiful rounded arches and a intricately painted ceiling. Nearby is the <strong>Vallone Dei Mulini</strong>, a steep canyon-like valley covered in lush greenery hosting the ruined structure of an ancient sawmill.</p>\n            <p>You might also consider taking a hike along the coast to the west of Sorrento to the ancient Roman villa ruins of the <strong>Regina Giovanna Bath</strong>. This spot is actually much more popular for its cove-like beach than its ruins, which hosts beautiful green-blue waters connected to the sea via an arch above the water. You can reach Regina Giovanna Beach by hiking about 3.9 miles (6.2 km) round-trip along the coast if starting near the Sorrento Cathedral.</p>"

The steep hike up to the Belvedere Santa Maria del Castello viewpoint is approximately 2.2 miles (3.6 km) one-way, beginning from the ferry terminal in Positano.</p>\n        <h3>Arienzo, Italy</h3>\n        <p>Several other small beaches are located along the coast between the cliffs of the mountains, such as the popular Arienzo Beach club just east of Positano, which offers amazing views looking up the coastline.

A bus stop is located next to the picturesque stone bridge which spans above this mini-fjord where it meets the ocean. The fjord hosts a small beach with vibrant blue waters and is quite an iconic spot along the Amalfi Coast.</p>",

Also impressive is the cathedral’s lovely Cloister del Paradiso surrounded by Moorish-style columns.</p>\n        <p>The Amalfi Cathedral sits behind Amalfi’s main plaza, the beautiful <strong>Piazza del Duomo</strong>. Despite its longer coastline, Amalfi only has a small beach, as most of its coast is taken up by Amalfi’s port and <strong>Marina Grande</strong>. In order to take in the best views of Amalfi, you can walk along the harbor walls of the Marina Grande.</p>\n        <h3>Torre dello Zico</h3>\n        <p>To hike up to the medieval ruins of the Torre dello Zico in the mountains above Amalfi, you’ll need to first reach the village of Pontone above Amalfi.

The hike is quite challenging, but offers amazing views overlooking the coastline, and the opportunity to walk along the medieval walls of this small ruined fortress.</p>",

Due to its tiny size, Capri is only accessible by ferry boat, which run very frequently connecting to Naples and Sorrento, as well as the Amalfi Coast towns of Positano, Amalfi, Minori, Maiori, and Cetara.</p>\n        <p>The island of Capri hosts several beautiful rustic villages, and a stunning coastline with with several sea caves and rocky islands which you can see via boat tours. Capri also hosts many lavish villas, as s well as some great hiking and many viewpoints overlooking the coast from atop the island’s high cliffs.</p>",

Approaching the island you’ll be able to appreciate the island’s beauty rather quickly.</p>\n        <p>From Marina Grande you can walk up the hill to the island’s main <strong>Piazzetta</strong> square, also known as Piaza Umberto I, from which you can enjoy stunningly picturesque views overlooking the coastline from high above. The Piazzetta square is the most urbanized part of the island, and in this area you’ll find many restaurants, cafes, bars, shops, and hotels.</p>\n        <p>From Piazzetta you can walk/hike along to several incredible viewpoints overlooking the coastline of the southern side of the island (above Marina Piccola). By far the most popular viewpoint and among the top attractions in Capri are the <strong>Gardens of Augustus</strong>, a lovely clifftop botanical garden offering breathtaking views over the coast and the iconic Faraglioni rock islands.</p>",

Just below this viewpoint is Via Tragara, a road that you can walk along for many more vantage points along the coast.</p>\n        <h3>Arco Naturale</h3>\n        <p>From Via Tragara you can connect to the pathway of Via del Pizzolungo, which follows along the clifftops above the coast with many more incredible views along the way. Eventually this path connects to the Via Arco Naturale, which concludes at a viewpoint overlooking the stunning <strong>Arco Naturale</strong> (Natural Arch) formation framed against the ocean in the background.</p>\n        <p>Continuing along this path from Belvedere Tragara to Arco Naturale is about 0.9 miles (1.4 km), and then another 0.8 miles (1.3 km) to return to Piazzetta Square from Arco Naturale.</p>\n        <h3>Punta Cannone</h3>\n        <p>From Capri’s Piazzetta you can also walk to Via Castello and onto a smaller road, continuing down to the end of the road to reach the Belvedere of Punta Cannone, an observation deck with similar views to the Gardens of Augustus overlooking Marina Piccola and Faraglioni. The walk to reach this viewpoint is about 10-15 minutes each way but also a little tricky to find.</p>",

				"body": "<h3>Villa Jovis</h3>\n        <p>Among Capri’s most interesting and oldest attractions is the <strong>Villa Jovis</strong> (Villa of Jupiter), which was built by the Ancient Roman Emperor Tiberius 2,000 years ago. While the villa is considered to be ruins, much of the structural elements remain and are open for exploration. You can also enjoy scenic views from Villa Jovis looking eastward from Capri towards the Sorrentine Peninsula on the Italian mainland.</p>\n        <p>The hike from Villa Jovis from Piazzetta is quite steep, with a distance of about 2.7 miles (4.4 km) round-trip.</p>\n        <h3>Vila Lysis</h3>\n        <p>If you hike all the way up to Villa Jovis, you should also strongly consider visiting the nearby <strong>Villa Lysis</strong>. There is a somewhat hidden primitive trail connecting the two villas, which is sometimes closed. If this is the case, you’ll add about (2 km) to your entire round-trip route from Piazzetta to see both villas.</p>\n        <p>The Villa Lysis displays a neoclassical architectural style built atop the cliffs high above the coast. Much more impressive than the villa’s interior is the villa’s lovely gardens, which hosts fine statues and a beautiful terrace with white columns offering picturesque views overlooking Marina Grande and the northern side of Capri’s coastline.</p>",

Along this path you can enjoy amazing views overlooking Marina Grande, with views reaching out to the Sorrentine Peninsula of Mainland Italy.</p>\n        <h3>Villa San Michele</h3>\n        <p>At the top of the Venetian Steps in Anacapri is Capri’s most popular villa, the early 20th century <strong>Villa San Michele</strong>. Inside the Villa San Michele you can admire its lavish furnishings, before walking through its beautiful gardens and admiring one of the most gorgeous views in Capri overlooking the coast and the Italian mainland.</p>",

				"body": "<p>Nearby the Villa San Michele at Piazza Vittoria is the chairlift station which takes visitors up to the top of <strong>Monte Solaro</strong> mountain, the highest peak on Capri. If you want a rather challenging hike, its also possible to reach Monte Solaro via a steep hiking trail, which takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour each way.</p>\n        <p>Obviously from the top of Monte Solaro you can enjoy the best views in Capri, with breathtaking panoramic coastal views over Capri reaching far over mainland Italy’s Sorrentine Peninsula.</p>\n        <h3>Hermitage of Santa Maria Cetrella</h3>\n        <p>The most popular trail on Monte Solaro is to the quaint 16th century Hermitage of Santa Maria of Cetrella, which provides even more perspectives overlooking Capri’s incredibly picturesque coastline. The trail to reach the Hermitage is approximately 0.8 miles (1.3 km) one-way from the Monte Solaro Chair Lift Station.</p>\n        <p>After hiking down a bit from the summit of Monte Solaro you’ll reach a fork in the trail, with one side leading to the Hermitage (right fork) and the other leading back down to Anacapri (left fork). The distance from the Hermitage of Santa Maria of Cetrella to the Villa San Michele is a steep one-way distance of about 1.2 miles (2 km).</p>",

From Capri’s Marina Grande you can take a boat tour around the island’s entire coastline, which stops at all of Capri’s most beautiful coastal features.</p>\n        <p>Some of the attractions you can see on Capri look very different and much more beautiful from the ocean, such as the Tiberius’ Leap next to Villa Jovis and the quaint Punta Carena Lighthouse on the island’s southwestern tip.</p>",

These highly photogenic and massive rocks tower above the sea, and one even has a natural arch that smaller boats can go through. It’s actually quite difficult to see this Faraglioni arch from Capri, which is one of the main sights along a boat tour around Capri.</p>\n        <p>One of the Faraglioni is actually connected to Capri with a tiny beach called Da Luigi, which you can hike down to from the Via Tragara road. Adjacent is the La Fontelina beach, which offers great views of the Faraglioni. Both of these beaches are very rocky but also rent out seats for beachgoers.</p>",

				"body": "<h3>Grotta Bianca & Grotta Verde</h3>\n        <p>The only way to see the stunning sea caves of Capri is via a boat tour. The <strong>Grotta Bianca</strong> (White Cave) is quite massive, much taller than any boat that visits it. Below Monte Solaro is the popular <strong>Grotta Verde</strong> (Green Cave) hosts vivid greenish-blue waters below a small cave that opens up on both sides. Some boat tours even allow tourists to swim in these stunning waters underneath the roof of the cave.</p>\n        <h3>Grotta Azzurra</h3>\n        <p>Capri’s most famous sea cave is the <strong>Grotta Azzurra</strong> (Blue Cave), which is known for its unreal naturally-illuminated vibrant blue waters. This cave is large however the entrance is very small, and so only very small boats can enter the Blue Cave. Some of the tour boats that encircle Capri Island will have tourists transfer to smaller boats in order to see inside the cave, so make sure yours does.</p>\n        <p>If you wish to only see the Grotta Azzurra (Blue Cave) by itself, you can head down to the northwestern coastline of Anacapri and take a very short boat tour to see inside the cave. The downside is that the lines for this method of seeing the caves are often quite long. Either way, it’s highly recommended to see Capri’s Blue Cave, as it’s quite an incredible sight.</p>",

				"body": "<p>The Cinque Terre region is a UNESCO world heritage site, consisting of five picturesque villages along the mountainous coastline of Northern Italy. These five villages from west to east are Monterosso al Mare (the largest village), Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore. A bit further east along the coast if the beautiful town of Portovenere, which is often visited by tourists to Cinque Terre.</p>\n        <p>The five villages of Cinque Terre are connected via a high speed train that runs beneath the mountains, stopping in each village. The train connects to the largest city in the region, La Spezia, which is the gateway city to Cinque Terre, along with Sestri Levante to the west. The villages are also connected by roads, however driving in Cinque Terre is difficult as the roads are very windy and crowded, and parking can be extremely challenging.</p>\n        <h3>Hiking Cinque Terre</h3>\n        <p>One of the best ways to experience the villages of Cinque Terre is by hiking along the old coastal trail (Sentiero Azzuro or Blue Path) which connects the villages. The Cinque Terre region actually hosts several great hikes, and even just wandering around the villages is a very scenic experience.</p>",
				"hidden_content": "<p>Because Cinque Terre is considered a national park, you’ll need to purchase a Cinque Terre Trekking Card if you wish to hike along the region’s trails. The card is relatively inexpensive and can be purchased online. Another option is to purchase the Cinque Terre Train Card, which allows access to all the hiking trails as well as unlimited train rides between the villages and La Spezia (as well as Levanto just west of Monterosso al Mare).</p>\n            <p>If you'd like to experience the towns of Cinque Terre from a different perspective, consider taking a boat tour along the coast to admire these gorgeous villages from the ocean.</p>"

The total one-way length of the entire route from the Monterosso al Mare Train Station to Riomaggiore is approximately 7.8 miles (12.6 km).</p>\n        <h3>Sentiero del Crinale (High Path)</h3>\n        <p>For an even more challenging trail you might consider the Sentiero del Crinale, also known as The High Path or Trail No. 1. This path is said to have originated in ancient Roman times and follows along the mountain tops high above the Cinque Terre Coast.</p>\n        <p>The entire route of the High Path technically connects Levante to Portovenere, with Cinque Terre making up only a portion of the route. The full route is just over  23 miles (37 km) in length with an elevation gain of almost 1 mile (1.6 km), but many tourists choose to only hike sections of the path.</p>\n        <p>One of the most popular sections of the High Path is from the southeastern most village of Riomaggiore to the town of Portovenere, which is extremely scenic, with a one-way distance of about 8.3 miles (13.4 km).

				"body": "<p>Florence’s <strong>Piazza del Duomo</strong> hosts the city’s famous Florence Cathedral, Giotto’s Bell Tower, the Baptistery of St. John, and the Opera Museum of sculptures. Due to their popularity, these attractions can often have long lines and even be sold out for the entire day. It’s highly recommended to pre-book a combination ticket, which includes all of the attractions around Florence’s Piazza del Duomo.</p>\n        <h3>Florence Cathedral</h3>\n        <p>The <strong>Florence Cathedral</strong> (or Duomo di Firenze) is Florence’s most iconic attraction apart from Michelangelo’s statue of David. This stunning 13th century church towers above the skyline, and its famous dome is the largest brick dome in the entire world. The Florence Cathedral rises high above the Piazza del Duomo and consists of several amazing structures.</p>\n        <p>The cathedral’s exterior is a marvel in itself when viewed from below, with its black stripes and outlines covering the white marble walls mixed with pinkish-red and green marble, creating a stunning visual effect. Within the cathedral is a massive space, as well as the intricately painted frescoes of the cathedral’s dome that you can look up at and admire. The cathedral also hosts the tomb of Brunelleschi.</p>\n        <h3>Brunelleschi’s Dome</h3>\n        <p>For an even closer view of the frescoes painted on the Florence Cathedral’s dome, you can climb to the top of the dome, which is separate from visiting the church’s interior. The dome  is often called the <strong>Cupola di Brunelleschi</strong> (Brunelleschi), named for the architect who designed it. From the outside of the dome you can enjoy gorgeous panoramic views overlooking Florence, high above the surrounding buildings.</p>\n        <h3>Giotto’s Bell Tower</h3>\n        <p>Also iconic is the Florence Cathedral’s massive gothic bell tower, the <strong>Campanile di Giotto</strong> (Giotto’s Bell Tower). You can also climb to the top of the bell tower for fantastic panoramic views over Florence, especially facing the cathedral’s Brunelleschi Dome. The bell tower is actually about 30 feet (10 m) shorter than the cathedral’s dome, but both offer different perspectives overlooking the city.</p>\n        <h3>Baptistery of St. John</h3>\n        <p>Also on the Piazza del Duomo is the <strong>Battistero di San Giovanni</strong> (Baptistery of Saint John), a stunning octagonal-shaped building with similar exterior marble designs to the adjacent Florence Cathedral. The Baptistery of St. John is among the oldest-standing buildings in Florence, built in the 11th century. The baptistery is renowned for its giant bronze-cast doors, but even more so for its breathtaking and highly intricate mosaics on the baptistery’s octagonal ceiling.</p>\n        <h3>Museo dell’Opera del Duomo Museum</h3>\n        <p>If you’re wondering why there aren’t many sculptures within the Florence Cathedral, this is because many of them have been removed and are housed at the nearby <strong>Museo dell’Opera del Duomo</strong> (Museum of the Works of the Cathedral), which is located just behind the cathedral. This museum hosts an incredible collection of sculptures and bronzes, with works by the great Michelangelo and Donatello.</p>",

These structures lining the bridge are multiple stories tall, and charmingly rustic in appearance.</p>\n        <h3>Ponte Santa Trinita</h3>\n        <p>Be sure to walk along the river for the most photogenic views of the Ponte Vecchio.

The library’s most famous feature is its lovely Reading Room.</p>\n        <h3>Medici Chapel</h3>\n        <p>The basilica’s beautiful <strong>Medici Chapel</strong> is incredibly lavish and covered in colored marble, with an octagonal dome painted with highly ornate frescos. Below the chapel is a crypt for the Medici family, and adjoining the chapel is the smaller Sagrestia Nuova (New Sacristy), a smaller room which along with its sculptures was designed by Michelangelo.</p>",

				"body": "<p>Northern Italy’s Lake Como is one of Italy’s top tourist attractions and is quite large, with three long arms stretching out in an upside-down Y-shape below tall mountains, just below the Southern Alps and Switzerland. Because of these tall mountains and the many old villages and villas along the lakeshore, Lake Como is one of the most scenic destinations in Italy. The nearest major city and often gateway city to Lake Como is Milan.</p>\n        <h3>Popular Towns & Transportation</h3>\n        <p>The largest towns along the lake are Como and Lecco, which are located along the shores of the two southern arms of Lake Como. Both Como and Lecco can be reached directly by train from Milan’s Central Station in about 40 minutes.</p>\n        <p>Most of the other popular towns along Lake Como are located where the three arms meet, including Bellagio, Varenna, and Menaggio. Due to the difficult geography, the most efficient way to get between these towns is via ferries, which run frequent connections between these towns and Cadenabbia (near Tremezzo).</p>",
				"hidden_content": "<p>On the western side of the lake the towns are connected to Como via bus, and on the eastern side the towns are connected to Lecco via rail. Of course roads also connect the towns, however its much easier to get around the region without a vehicle, although there are car ferries that operate between the towns in the center of the lake as well.</p>"

				"body": "<p>Como is definitely the most popular town for visitors to Lake Como, and is located at the end of the western arm of the lake. Como’s compact historic center still retains some of its imposing Roman walls and towers which once surrounded it, especially prevalent on the southern side of the city. Most visitors enter Como through this side at the towering Porta Torre medieval gate to the city.</p>\n        <h3>Basilica di San Fedele</h3>\n        <p>In the middle of Como’s historic center is the <strong>Basilica di San Fedele</strong>, a lovely Romanesque church with a bell tower and impressive interiors. At night you can watch as images are projected onto the church’s exterior.</p>\n        <h3>Como Cathedral</h3>\n        <p>The top attraction in Como is the <strong>Como Cathedral</strong>, a beautiful 14th century church mainly displaying gothic architecture with a mix of other styles. Inside the cathedral is majestic, hosting a small collection of medieval tapestries.</p>\n        <h3>Tempio Voltiano (Volta Temple)</h3>\n        <p>Just outside of the walled center along Como’s coastline is the Tempio Voltano (or <strong>Volta Temple</strong>), a grand neoclassical structure hosting a small museum. This museum is dedicated to the inventor of the electric battery, Alessandro Volta, who was born in the town of Como. Inside the museum you can see the voltaic pile batteries created by Volta, as well as the instruments he used.</p>\n        <h3>Villa Olmo</h3>\n        <p>Along the shore of Lake Como just north of the town of Como is the elegant <strong>Villa Olmo</strong>, a large neoclassical estate. The villa’s decadent interior hosts various public exhibitions. Most visitors however come to the villa to admire its beautiful lakeside gardens, which offer views looking out over the lake at the city of Como.</p>\n        <h3>Basilica di Sant’Abbondio</h3>\n        <p>On the western side of Como is the rustic Romanesque-style <strong>Basilica di Sant’Abbondio</strong>, which was built in the 11th century. This church is notable for its twin bellowers and old arched columns lining the basilica’s interior.</p>\n        <h3>Baradello Castle</h3>\n        <p>Just south of Como is the <strong>Castello Baradello</strong>, a small medieval castle which rises above the forests on a hilltop. You can explore the ruins of the castle and enjoy amazing views overlooking Como from the hilltop. The hike to reach the castle from Como is quite steep, with a distance of about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) round-trip if starting from Como’s Porta Torre medieval gate.</p>",

Underwater in the area around the island are the remains of ancient Roman ruins, which you can see by taking a snorkeling or boat tour from the beach.</p>",

Apart from the Leaning Tower and the adjacent Pisa Cathedral complex, Pisa only has a handful of attractions. Most tourists only visit Pisa for a few hours to see the tower, or at most stay overnight.</p>\n        <p>Pisa is very well-connected to several large Italian cities, and acts as a major transit hub for the region, with many trains passing through the city. By train, Pisa is about 1 hour from Florence, 3 hours from Rome (via Florence), 3.5 hours from Venice or Milan (both also via Florence), and 1.5 hours from La Spezia (near Cinque Terre). Due to its proximity, Pisa is an extremely popular day-trip for many travelers.</p>\n        <p>It’s important that you know where the Leaning Tower of Pisa is located, as some tourists can’t find it since it’s to the north of the city center, quite far from Pisa Central Station (about a 20 minute walk). From Pisa’s smaller San Rossore Station it’s only about a 10 minute walk, however the walk from the Central Station is much more scenic.</p>",

Amazingly, the tower was constructed in the 12th century and had been slowly titling for centuries before finally being stabilized very recently, at the turn of the millennium. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a very elegant structure made of white marble and stone, rising up about 186 feet (57 m) above the piazza below.</p>\n        <h3>Purchasing Tickets in Advance</h3>\n        <p>Many tourists aren’t aware that it’s also possible to climb the stairs to the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which offers fantastic views over the Piazza del Duomo. This is a very popular activity however, and so you’ll want to book your tickets for this ahead of time.</p>\n        <p>When buying your ticket be sure to get a combination deal with the other structures of the piazza, including the Baptistery, Camposanto, and Opera Museum. The tickets also come with a free visit to the Pisa Cathedral, which is also extremely popular for tourists.</p>",

In fact, the Leaning Tower is the campanile tower of the Pisa Cathedral.</p>\n        <h3>Pisa Cathedral</h3>\n        <p>The Duomo di Pisa (or <strong>Pisa Cathedral</strong>) is a majestic church built in a highly ornate architectural style called Pisan Romanesque. The cathedral is almost 1,000 years old, with its exterior covered in lavish marble stripes to create a stunning visual effect. Additionally, the exterior is highly embellished with many details such as columns and loggias.</p>\n        <p>Inside the Pisa Cathedral is a decadent display, with intricate wooden ceilings covered in gold leaf and giant marble columns. The cathedral also hosts complex mosaics and medieval frescoes.</p>\n        <h3>Pisa Baptistery</h3>\n        <p>Another gorgeous structure of the cathedral is the <strong>Pisa Baptistery</strong>, a large rounded structure with many elegant gothic details. Similarly to the Pisa Cathedral, its Baptistery is constructed of lavish marble. Especially marvelous is the view of the Baptistery’s dome when looking up inside the structure, which is encircled by striped arches. Interestingly, the Pisa Baptistery also has a slight tilt compared to the ground, making it uneven.</p>\n        <h3>Camposanto</h3>\n        <p>Pisa’s <strong>Camposanto Monumentale</strong> (Monumental Cemetery) is located behind the Pisa Cathedral and consists of a massive rectangular building with wide hallways. These hallways encircle the building, and in the center of the Camposanto is a long open courtyard surrounded by gothic-style window arches.</p>\n        <h3>Museo dell’Opera Museum</h3>\n        <p>Similar to the Florence Cathedral, the treasures and sculptures of the Pisa Cathedral are housed within a museum to preserve them, called the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo. Although small, the museum hosts an impressive collection of elaborate sculptures created by the great Nicola Pisano and his son, Giovanni Pisano.</p>\n        <h3>Pisa Walls</h3>\n        <p>Along the northern side of the Piazza del Duomo are the preserved medieval <strong>Walls of Pisa</strong>, which actually stretch across most of the northern side of the historic city center, as well as much of the eastern side of the city. The best place to admire these walls however is behind the large grassy fields of the Piazza del Duomo.</p>",

Also on the plaza is the lovely Church of Santo Stefano dei Cavalieri with its decadent ceiling.</p>\n        <h3>San Michele in Borgo Church</h3>\n        <p>A few blocks south of the Piazza dei Cavalieri near the river is the Church of San Michele in Borgo, which is over 1,000 years old.

The views from the bridge are especially pleasing at sunset.</p>\n        <h3>Palazzo Blu (Blue Palace)</h3>\n        <p>Pisa’s top attraction outside of the Piazza del Duomo is the gorgeous <strong>Palazzo Blu</strong> (or Blue Palace), named for its distinguished deep rustic blue color. This medieval palazzo is especially beautiful as it sits along the Arno River. Within the Palazzo Blu you’ll find a museum containing a collection of fine Italian art, stately apartments with historic furnishings, and various temporary exhibits.</p>\n        <h3>Santa Maria della Spina Church</h3>\n        <p>Further west along the Arno River from Palazzo Blu is Pisa’s next most popular attraction outside the Piazza del Duomo, the <strong>Church of Santa Maria della Spina</strong>.

Due to its ease of access, Pompeii is an extremely popular day-trip from Rome, Naples, and even the nearby Amalfi Coast.</p>\n        <h3>Herculaneum & Vesuvius</h3>",

All of these sites were buried underneath volcanic ash from the eruption of nearby Mount Vesuvius, which still towers above the landscape today. Because of the volcanic ash, many of these ancient sites have been incredibly well-preserved and are now UNESCO world heritage sites.</p>"

				"body": "<p>The <strong>Pompeii Archaeological Site</strong> sprawls across a large area, hosting the remains of thousands of structures with various levels of preservation. Pompeii was a significant city in Ancient Rome until it was swiftly destroyed and buried deep in volcanic ash by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE.</p>\n        <p>Because of its preservation under the ash, Pompeii provides an incredible and unique snapshot into ancient Roman life in a 2,000 year-old city. It’s recommended to purchase your tickets to Pompeii in advance in order to avoid waiting in long lines.</p>\n        <p>Many of the ancient structures and rooms of Pompeii are available for tourists to freely explore on their own. A grid-system of ancient roads exists throughout the city, surrounding the densely-packed buildings.</p>\n        <p>Due to its massive size and the high levels of detail seen in many of the structures, you might need more than a single day if you want to thoroughly explore these ruins. You should also consider doing a guided tour for Pompeii, as there isn’t much historical context provided around the archaeological site.</p>\n        <h3>Pompeii Forum</h3>\n        <p>Pompeii’s most iconic attraction is the <strong>Pompeii Forum</strong>, the expansive public square which hosts large sculptures and is surrounded by columns and ancient temples, such as the Sanctuary of Apollo and the Temple of Giove. Behind the Temple of Giove are the stunning Forum Baths with much of its intricately carved ceilings and many statues and frescoes still intact. This is just one of many bath complexes located at Pompeii.</p>\n        <p>Just south of the Forum are the Basilica Scavi with its giant statues of men and an angel, and the <strong>Temple of Venus</strong> which provides breathtaking views overlooking the mountains of the Sorrentine Peninsula.</p>\n        <h3>Villas and Houses</h3>\n        <p>Pompeii also hosts countless houses, many of which were villas owned by the elite, which were lavishly decorated with intricate frescoes and mosaics, and constructed with features like enclosed gardens, swimming pools, fountains, and lavish columns. There are many of these houses around Pompeii worth seeing, with some of the most notable being the House of the Vetti, House of the Tragic Poet, and <strong>House of Merander</strong>, amongst many others.</p>\n        <p>Perhaps the most incredible sight at Pompeii is the <strong>Villa of the Mysteries</strong> located at the very northern end of Pompeii, which has been stunningly well-preserved. This villa hosts countless colorful frescoes and murals with rich details. Additionally, the Villa of the Mysteries is huge with many rooms.</p>\n        <h3>Amphitheater and More</h3>\n        <p>Additional amazing attractions at Pompeii include the strikingly well-preserved <strong>Teatro Grande</strong> (Great Theatre), the smaller Teatro Piccolo theatre, and the highly photogenic <strong>Quadriportico</strong>, a giant courtyard surrounded by columns (once supporting a colonnade) located adjacent to the two theaters. Also very impressive is the giant <strong>Amphitheater of Pompeii</strong>, which hosts gladiatorial fights that could be watched by up to 20,000 spectators.</p>\n        <p>Other must-see attractions amongst the ruins of Pompeii include the Stabiane bath complex, the lush vineyards and striking ruins of the Garden of the Fugitives, and the Lupanare, a stunningly well-preserved two-story Roman brothel house.</p>\n        <h3>Museum and Artifacts</h3>\n        <p>Be sure to also visit the Antiquarium Museum of Pompeii, which hosts illustrations and 3D models of what the structures of Pompeii would have looked like before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. This museum helps fill the gap when looking at the ruins to help you visualize what the site looked like in its heyday. The museum also hosts educational films about Pompeii.</p>\n        <p>If you’re looking to see the incredible artifacts from Pompeii, some of them are hosted around the archaeological site, however many of them are on display at the Naples National Archaeological Museum.</p>",

Some of the houses also host beautiful frescoes and sculptures, and unlike Pompeii, certain elements such as wooden doors have been preserved at Herculaneum.</p>\n        <p>The site also hosts a ruined bath house and tight streets that you can wander around and explore. If you’d like to see the many artifacts found at Herculaneum, they are on display at the Naples National Archaeological Museum.</p>\n        <p>To reach Herculaneum by train from Naples you’ll need to ride the train from the Central Station to the Portici-Ercolano Station for about 20 minutes, and then take a short bus ride or walk about 20 minutes to reach the entrance to the site.</p>",

After filling the palace, the Romans built the Baths of Trajan atop the palace, whose remains can still be seen above ground. Because of this, the remains of the palace have been well-preserved, and you can take an amazing tour through the Domus Area which incorporates virtual reality.</p>",

				"body": "<p>The amazingly picturesque city of Venice is built atop an array of islands within the massive Venetian Lagoon of Northern Italy. All of Venice’s top attractions are located on the islands, which are the historic center of the city and make-up a major UNESCO world heritage site. These islands were the capital of the Republic of Venice, a very wealthy and significant maritime republic which survived for 1,100 years.</p>\n        <p>Modern Venice is located across a long bridge which connects the islands to Mainland Italy. Venice’s main group of islands are separated by a labyrinth of tiny canals, with the giant Grand Canal winding through the center of the city. An extensive ferry system connects the Venetian islands, many of which are only accessible by boat, including the islands of Giudecca and San Giorgio Maggiore, which are located just south of the main islands.</p>\n        <p>Apart from its countless canals, Venice is known for its incredibly beautiful Venetian Architecture, which ca be seen in many of the city’s historic buildings and has been reproduced all around the world. The Venetian gothic and Renaissance-era styles are the most prominent within the city, especially amongst the lavish canal homes, palazzos, and squares of Venice.</p>",
				"hidden_content": "<p>With the immense beauty seen throughout the entirety of Venice, wandering around the streets and canals is quite a scenic and even romantic experience. In fact, the only way to get around most of the islands is either on foot or by boat, with Venice’s main train station and highway bridge terminating at the entrance to the islands on the western side (which conveniently also hosts parking lots).</p>\n            <h3>Burano & Murano</h3>\n            <p>Approximately 1 mile (1.5 km) north of the main islands are Venice’s Murano Islands, and about 5 miles (8 km) northeast are the Burano Islands, which are known for their exceptionally beautiful and colorful canal homes. Both Burano and Murano can only be reached via ferry or boat from Venice.</p>\n            <h3>Carnival of Venice</h3>\n            <p>An especially exciting time to visit Venice is during the annual Carnival of Venice, a famous celebration known for its distinctive masks. The event takes place for approximately 2 weeks around February, ending on the first day of Christian Lent each year.</p>"

Verona is located in Northern Italy along the Adige River near Lake Garda, just south of the Italian Alps.</p>\n        <p>Verona is also popular for half-day visits or day-trips due to it being a major transportation hub located in between the cities of Milan and Lake Como to the west, Venice to the east, Innsbruck, Munich, and the Italian Alps to the north, and Florence and Bologna to the south.</p>\n        <p>If you plan to see several of Verona’s attractions, the cheapest way to do so is to purchase the Verona Card, which allows access to most of the city’s top attractions for a much lower price than paying for each sight separately.</p>",
