Amazingly, Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the US and one of the deepest in the world, at nearly 1,950 feet (600 m) deep. The volcanic Mt. Mazama that Crater Lake rests in was almost 1 mile (1.6 km) taller before its eruption, and yet the lake still sits at a significant elevation of 7,000-8,000 feet (2,100-2,400 m).</p><p>Surrounding Crater Lake is Rim Road, which hosts many viewpoints overlooking the lake. Also surrounding the lake are dense sub-alpine forests filled with all types of wildlife that you might encounter during your trip to the national park.</p><p>To the north of Crater Lake is the Umpqau National Forest, which has several gorgeous waterfalls located along Highway 138 that you might like to visit before or after your visit to the national park.</p>",

This trail is about 3.1 mile (5 km) round-trip with just over 1,000 feet (300 m) of elevation gain.</p><p>Just south of Rim Village and the Steel Visitor Center is the intriguing <strong>Godfrey Glen Trail</strong>, which offers views over a canyon filled with very strange pinnacle formations.

If you're visiting Crater Lake from Portland or Seattle, you might want to stop to see these waterfalls (in reverse order) along the way to Crater Lake's northern entrance. Coming from the south, you'll want to wait until after visiting Crater Lake to see these waterfalls, and coming from Bend or the northeast you might visit them before entering the national park.</p><h3>Clearwater Falls & Whitehorse Falls</h3><p>Driving west along Highway 138 from Crater Lake you'll first encounter the beautiful <strong>Clearwater Falls</strong>, which cascades over lush mossy rocks and logs. A bit further down the highway is the small but lovely <strong>Whitehorse Falls</strong>. Both of these waterfalls can be seen with a very short 1 minute walk from their parking lots.</p><h3>Watson Falls</h3><p>Further west you'll encounter <strong>Watson Falls</strong>. From the parking lot you can admire a tiny serene waterfall. Behind it the striking Watson Falls flowing over a tall cliff, which can be admired via a short 0.6 mile (1 km) round-trip walk from the parking lot.<h3>Toketee Falls</h3><p>A bit further west along the highway is the majestic <strong>Toketee Falls</strong>, which flows over surreal geometric cliffs made of columnar basalt. You can reach this waterfall with an easy 0.8 mile (1.3 km) round-trip hike through the dense forest.</p><h3>Additional Waterfalls</h3><p>If you were to continue much further down this highway, you'd have the opportunity to see several more stunning waterfalls, most notably Fall Creek Falls and nearby Susan Creek Falls, which can both be reached with a short hike.</p>",
