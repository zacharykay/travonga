This trail is a combination of the Miller Point Trail and Juniper Draw Loop Trail, taking you through most of the park.</p><p>Alternatively, you might park at the <strong>Miller Point</strong> / Eagle Point Trailhead, which hosts a lovely stone gazebo offering amazing views overlooking the complex formations of the gorge, from the cliffs high above the gorge. If you were to hike the trail to this point you would need to come up many stairs to enjoy this view. This trailhead also works as an alternative starting point for the <strong>Juniper Loop Trail</strong>.</p><p>Be sure to also spend some time exploring the <strong>Moon Caves</strong>, which are located along the road to the Junipder Draw Loop Trailhead. These caves are formed by a series of towering near-vertical winding canyon walls, many of which are extremely thin but create passageways large enough for people to walk through. The Moon Caves are quite unique and incredible, so be sure to visit them.</p>`,

It's highly recommended to book your tour at least a few hours ahead of time as to save yourself from long waits or even not being able to do the tour at all.</p><p>Afterwards you can drive up through the park's main road, <strong>Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive</strong>, stopping at the viewpoints along the way up such as the Mather Overlook as you make your way towards the top.</p><h3>Ancient Bristlecone Trees</h3><p>At the very top of Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive, you'll find several of the park's most popular hikes, including the <strong>Bristlecone Pine Trail</strong>. This trail takes you on a 2.8 mile (4.5 km) round-trip hike amongst ancient trees while offering spectacular views of the desert below and Wheeler Peak above.</p><h3>Wheeler Peak Glacier Trail</h3><p>You can extend the Bristlecone Pine hike to 4.6 miles (7.4 km) round-trip if you'd also like to see Nevada's only glacier up-close, via <strong>Glacier Trail</strong> which extends beyond the Bristlecone Trail. Both trails are at a very high elevation of approximately 9,200-9,800 feet (2,800-3,000 m) and also pass through an alpine forest along the way up.</p><h3>Alpine Lakes Trail</h3><p>Another possibility is adding on the extra 1.9 mile (3.1 km) <strong>Alpine Lakes Loop</strong> to either the Bristlecone Pine Trail or Glacier Trail, which takes you past two small but stunning and serene lakes.</p>`,

All of these formations can be seen with extremely short walks, the longest being the 0.3 miles (0.5 km) round-trip to see Elephant Rock.
