The trail then heads back down to loop around several smaller geysers and springs within the <strong>Geyser Hill Complex</strong> of the Upper Geyser Basin (just north of Old Faithful).</p><h3>Firehole River Geysers from Old Faithful</h3><p>The most highly recommended option however is to continue beyond the Geyser Hill Complex to the many gorgeous geysers and pools alongside the Firehole River.
