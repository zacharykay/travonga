Upon reaching the gondola summit station you'll find the <strong>Sky Pilot Suspension Bridge</strong>, which spans a deep canyon and offers incredible views overlooking the Howe Sound bay below.</p><p>Among the most popular trails from the gondola station is the 1 mile (1.6 km) round-trip Panorama Trail, which ventures through the forest and offers more stunning views above the Howe Sound and valley below, especially from the Stawamus Chief Outlook Viewpoint. There are also many other longer hiking trails to choose from in order to explore these mountains.</p>`,

				body: `<p>To the north of Squamish is the incredible Garibaldi Provincial Park, which features several extremely popular longer-distance hiking routes centered around Garibaldi Lake. All of these hiking routes begin from the Rubble Creek Trailhead.</p><h3>Garibaldi Lake</h3><p>The shortest route is the 11.2 mile (18 km) round-trip trail to the shore of the pristine glacial <strong>Garibaldi Lake</strong>, which sits deep in the forested wilderness below massive mountains. This trail also passes by the striking sheer cliffs of the Barrier Viewpoint along the way, and is quite challenging, requiring an elevation gain of approximately 3,300 feet (1,000 m).</p><h3>Panorama Ridge</h3><p>You can extend the Garibaldi Lake trail by hiking to the <strong>Panorama Ridge</strong> viewpoint, which hosts majestic views overlooking Garibaldi Lake and the surrounding mountains, just below Panorama Peak. This route has a round-trip distance of about 17.8 miles (28.6 km) and roughly 5,400 feet (1,650 m) of elevation gain.</p><h3>Black Tusk</h3><p>An even longer but extremely rewarding option is to add on the picturesque <strong>Black Tusk</strong> formation to your route, a 2.8 mile round-trip spur trail along the way to Panorama Ridge. With Panorama Ridge and the Black Tusk the total round-trip hiking distance is about 20.8 miles (33.5 km), with an elevation gain of approximately 6,000 feet (1,830 m).</p><h3>More Hiking Options</h3>`,
				hidden_content: `<p>Alternatively hiking to the Black Tusk and excluding Panorama Ridge is a round-trip distance of about 16 miles (25.7 km), with approximately 4,500 feet (1,375 m) of elevation gain.</p><p>The hike to Garibaldi Lake is highly recommend, as are the longer options if you're capable. Note that there are camping sites available along the route if you wish to complete this hike over the course of two days. It's also possible to hike much further into the wilderness such as to the shore of Cheakamus Lake, which connects to the Panorama Ridge Trail and is an extra 15.8 miles (25.4 km) round-trip to reach, with a campground located at the Cheakamus Lakeshore.</p>`

Nearby you might consider leaping into a beautiful deep river gorge from the Whistler Bungee Bridge if you are a thrill seeker.</p><h3>Whistler Mountain</h3><p>Further north is the town of Whistler, a popular tourist destination with many ski resorts. The town sits below <strong>Whistler Mountain</strong> and Blackcomb Mountain, with many chairlifts connecting the mountains. In the summer many of the ski trails serve as hiking trails set amongst lush meadows, ponds, and glaciers. These two mountains together offer countless miles of hiking trails, set amongst a picturesque and pristine mountain wilderness.</p><h3>Peak 2 Peak Gondola</h3><p>Connecting Whistler Mountain and Blackcomb Peak is the Peak 2 Peak Gondola, a 1.9 mile (3 km) long horizontal gondola which rises over 1,400 feet (430 m) above the ground below. The Peak 2 Peak Gondola and many of the other ski lifts operate in the summer along with buses, making the many amazing hiking trails of these two mountains very easy to access.</p>`,

From Whistler you'll need to take the Whistler Village Gondola to The Peak Express chairlift to reach the trailhead atop Whistler Mountain.</p><p>The High Note Trail circles around the edge of the top of Whistler Mountain through serene meadows while offering breathtaking views over the gorgeous glacial <strong>Cheakamus Lake</strong> below. The trail follows along the High Note Trail before turning left at the Singing Pass Trail Junction, passing the Symphony Bowl and Harmony Lake, before arriving back at the Roundhouse Lodge, where you can take the Whistler Village Gondola back down the mountain.</p>`,

The lakes are all vibrant bright blue in color and set within lush alpine forests.</p><p>The three Joffre Lakes are connected via the 5.2 mile (8.4 km) round-trip Joffre Lakes Trail, which travels up the mountain concluding at <strong>Upper Joffre Lake</strong>, which sits below a massive pristine glacier. Be sure to get arrive for this hike as early as possible as the trail is extremely popular and can be quite crowded later in the day.</p><h3>Lillooet Lake</h3><p>After enjoying the Joffre Lakes you might like to see one end of the extremely long and serene <strong>Lillooet Lake</strong>, a vast whitish-blue lake which occupies an immense valley.</p>`,

Unlike the Capilano Suspension Bridge this bridge is free, although it is much smaller. Across the bridge are many trails, the most popular being the 1.2 mile (1.9 km) round-trip Lynn Canyon Loop, which features views of a striking blue-green river as well as small waterfalls.</p>`,

It's highly recommended to pre-book reservations for this ferry, especially if you will be taking you vehicle.</p><p>The ferry ride from Vancouver similarly takes about 90 minutes, however the ferry station is located in the suburb of Tsawwassen and lands in the town of Swartz Bay north of Victoria. This adds about another 1-2 hours of driving to get from Downtown Vancouver to Downtown Victoria, without having to cross an international border.</p><p>Victoria's most popular attraction, the Butchart Gardens are located in Brentwood Bay, about 20 minutes south of the ferry landing in Swartz Bay, while Victoria is located quite further south.</p>`,

This vast elegant building combines Neo-Baroque and Romanesque Revival architectural styles.</p><p>Across from the Parliament Building is the Royal British Columbia Museum, which hosts extensive exhibits and collections in First Nations' history, modern history, and natural history. Adjacent to the museum is another of Victoria's most beautiful structures, the majestic waterfront <strong>Fairmont Express</strong>, a chateau-like hotel which is quite photogenic.</p><p>West of Downtown in the old James Bay neighborhood is <strong>Fisherman's Wharf</strong>, an area along the harbor consisting of several floating piers lined with shops and restaurants, as well as beautiful colorful floating homes. Fisherman's Wharf is quite photogenic and is a very popular tourist area.</p><p>East of Downtown Victoria is a lovely late 19th century mansion, the <strong>Craigdarroch Castle</strong>.

At the outbreak of WWII the castle was purchased by the British Royal Family, who planned to relocate to it during the war in order to stay safe, however they ended up staying in London.</p><p>Hatley Castle is also extremely well-known as the filming location for Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, featured in nearly every X-Men and Deadpool film since X2: X-Men United.

Finlayson. From the top you can enjoy stunning panoramic views over the vast forests in the area, as well as over nearby Victoria.

These beaches are located just off the highway along the coast of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, a long body of water which separates Washington's Olympic Peninsula from Vancouver Island.</p><h3>French Beach</h3><p>The first major beach you'll encounter is the stunning <strong>French Beach Provincial Park</strong>, which you can admire with a short walk from the parking lot.</p><h3>Sandcut Beach</h3><p>Continue up the coast to nearby <strong>Sandcut Beach</strong>, which is known for its gorgeous waterfalls which flow from Sandcut Creek over a tiny cliff onto the rocky beach. The trail to reach the waterfall begins by journeying through a lush temperate rainforest before reaching the beach, at which point you'll walk east along the coast until reaching the falls. The round-trip length for this hike is approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 km) starting from the Jordan River Regional Park Sandcut Beach Parking Lot.</p>`,
