Be sure to take in views over the reservoir set amongst this picturesque lake from the Old Dillon Reservoir Trailhead near Silverthorne, as well as the Sapphire Point Overlook on the opposite side of the lake.</p><h3>Breckenridge, Colorado</h3><p>Just south of Silverthorne is the extremely popular ski resort town of <strong>Breckenridge</strong>, which hosts a lovely Main Street lined with many great reastaurants, cafes, shops, boutiques, and bars, as well as many hotels.</p><h3>Reaching Aspen, Colorado</h3><p>After Silvethorne you can take a shortcut to reach Aspen, however this highway is only open during warmer months after the snow melts.

The 1.9 mile (3.1 km) round-trip Maroon Bells Scenic Loop Trail ventures beyond the lake and offers fantastic views of these iconic mountain peaks. It's even possible to continue hiking far beyond into the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness, which hosts many more trails.

Unfortunately this hike has become so popular that you now must pay to reserve a permit ahead of time in order to visit the lake.</p><p>The Hanging Lakes Trail hike has a significant elevation gain of about 1,200 feet (370 m) but is only 2.8 miles (4.5 km) round-trip.

This highway ventures through the beautiful mountains to the south of the national park, passing through the stunning towns of Ouray and Silverton, before ending in the popular toursit town of Durango. Along the highway are the challenging Island and Ice Lake Trails, which require most of a day to hike (due to the high elevation).</p>`,

Other notable nearby viewpoints include Cedar Point (which requires a longer walk than the other viewpoints) and Dragon Point.</p><p>Afterwards you can continue to the end of the road along the southern canyon, where you'll find the 1.4 mile (2.3 km) round-trip <strong>Warner Point Nature Trail</strong>. This trail leads to another viewpoint over the canyon after walking through a forest.

    body: `<p>Along the highway just after the Ice Lakes Trailhead is perhaps the most scenic corridor of the Million Dollar Highway, as it leads into a tiny valley surrounded by several massive mountains. At the center of this valley is the tiny town of <strong>Silverton</strong>, which is extremely picturesque, especially when viewed from the highway.</p><p>Silverton hosts a lovely historic downtown district, lined with many shops and restaurants. Walking through Downtown Silverton you can appreciate the majestic mountains that tower high above the city.</p><h3>Pinkerton Hot Springs</h3><p>Before reaching Durango, you might consider a quick stop at the unique man-made <strong>Pinkerton Hot Springs</strong> structure, which is difficult to describe but quite interesting and located just along the highway.</p>`,

    body: `<p>Colorado National Monument is a stunning landscape of canyons and complex rock formations, located next to the Colorado River and the city of Grand Junction in Western Colorado, adjacent to the Utah border. Colorado National Monument is postioned about halfway between Moab and Glenwood Springs, about 1.5 hours by car from either city.</p><p>Next to this national monument are the McInnis Canyons, which are home to the second largest concentration of natural arches in the world, second only to the nearby Arches National Park of Utah.</p>`,

Along this windy road to the top are several viewpoints, including the <strong>Balanced Rock View</strong> which provides a picturesque view of a balancing rock formation. After this viewpoint are several road tunnels, before reaching the <strong>Fruita Canyon View</strong> near the top, which overlooks the canyon you just summited.</p><h3>Book Cliffs View & Window Rock</h3><p>A bit further along the road is the national monument’s visitor center.

All of the major viewpoints will be listed here. First be sure to stop at the <strong>Independence Monument View</strong>, which overlooks a highly photogenic towering stone pillar called Independence Monument.</p><h3>Grand View</h3><p>The next viewpoint is probably the best in the entire national monument, <strong>Grand View</strong>. This viewpoint offers incredibly majestic views in almost every direction, overlooking many complex formations, buttes, and cliffs. Just a bit further down the roads is <strong>Monument Canyon View</strong>, which overlooks some of the same formations from a different perspective.</p>`,

The full trail length out and back is about 9.5 miles (15.3 km) round-trip with significant elevation gain coming back up the canyon, however you can also turn around at any point along the trail to make this hike shorter.</p><h3>Monument Canyon Loop Trail</h3><p>A shorter hiking option for exploring Monument Canyon is the Monument Canyon Loop Trail, which circles around a large mesa formation, passing right by the Independence Monument and passing near the cliffs below Grand View. This trail is about 4.6 miles (7.4 km) round-trip and actually begins outside of the national monument at the Monument Canyon Trailhead. This trailhead is located at the edge of town along Highway 340, several miles to the east of Colorado National Monument’s western entrance.</p>`,

The Ute Canyon View offers wide 180 degree views looking down two long corridors of the canyon from the point where it bends.</p><h3>Eastern Viewpoints</h3><p>Just beyond Ute Canyon, be sure to stop at the <strong>Red Canyon Overlook</strong>, which is located at the beginning of another long scenic canyon. Further down the road is another highly recommended stop, the <strong>Cold Shivers Point Overlook</strong>.

Nearby Arches National Park in Utah is the record holder, however this arch-filled area is largely unknown and rarely seen by humans. The trail connecting these arches is known as the Rattlesnake Arches Trail, along which you can see arches including the <strong>East Rim Arch</strong>, <strong>Cedar Tree Arch</strong>, <strong>Bridge Arch</strong>, and more.</p><p>Unfortunately the Rattlesnake Arches area is extremely under-developed and thus if you have a high clearance four-wheel drive vehicle, you can easily access the trail, making it roughly a 7 mile (11.3 km) round-trip hike from the Upper Trailhead.</p><p>Accessing the hike with a regular vehicle the hike is about 14 miles (22.5 km), with the added length being what you would cover with a 4x4 vehicle. If you manage to get to the trail, you likely won't see many other people around. The longer version of this trail begins from the Pollock Bench Trailhead.</p>`,

This section of the park hosts other smaller ruins and viewpoints as well, however you might consider skipping it if you have limited time to visit Mesa Verde, especially if you can't tour the Long House.</p>`,

Be sure to also see the monument's Visitor Center if you have time, which will help you understand what the original structure would have looked like.</p><p>Aztec Ruins National Monument is located in a remote part of New Mexico near the town of Farmington, located approximately 1.3 hours by car from the Mesa Verde Vistor Center.

This trail has an elevation gain of approximately 1,700 feet (520 m). Toweing above Sky Pond you can admire the stunning Sharkstooth Mountain ridge.</p><p>Alternatively you might hike past the waterfall to the first lake (The Loch) for a round-trip hiking distance of 5.4 miles (8.7 km), however the full route is highly recommended.</p><h3>Dream Lake & Emerlad Lake</h3><p>The most easily-accessible lake trail that still offers magnificent scenery can be reached from the nearby Bear Lake Trailhead at the end of Bear Lake Road. This is perhaps the park's most popular hike, the Emerald Lake Trail, which passes by several gorgeous lakes including <strong>Dream Lake</strong> and <strong>Emerald Lake</strong>.</p><p>Along this 3.1 mile (5 km) round-trip hike you're also surrounded by many majestic mountain peaks and picturesque scenery. You might also consider adding on an additional alpine lake, Lake Haiyaha, for a round-trip hiking distance of 4.9 miles (7.9 km). Be sure to also see Bear Lake which sits at the trailhead.</p><h3>Hiking Option to Combine All Lakes</h3><p>You might even consider combining the entire Emerald Lake Trail with the entire Sky Pond Trail and Alberta Falls, for a round-trip hiking distance of about 10.6 miles/17.1 km (11 miles/17.7 km), including the small spur trail to view Lake Haiyaha. This route passes some of the most beautiful scenery and lakes that the national park has to offer.</p>`,

There's also the <strong>Medano Creek</strong> on the side of the dunes, a popular location for visitors to cool off and relax while enjoying the stunning scenery.</p><h3>Zapata Falls</h3><p>Nearby the Great Sand Dunes you might hike the short 1 mile (1.6 km) round-trip trail up to rocky and beautiful <strong>Zapata Falls</strong>, which is located just outside the national park.</p>`,

Taos is famous for its UNESCO world heritage site, the <strong>Taos Pueblo</strong>, which features two incredible multi-story adobe houses which are between 600-1,000 years old.</p><p>These very old adobe structures include the <strong>Hlauuma</strong> (North House) and <strong>Hlaukwima</strong> (South House). You can also admire the nearby ruins of the <strong>San Jeronimo Mission Church</strong>, built by the Spanish in the early 1600s.</p><p>Be sure to also visit the Downtown Taos Historic District to see impressive adobe architecture, centered around Taos Plaza. In this area you'll find shops selling Native American crafts, as well as cafes, restaurants, and art galleries. This area also hosts several historic homes which have been preserved as museums.</p><h3>Rio Grande Gorge Bridge</h3><p>Just west of Taos is the impressive <strong>Rio Grande Gorge Bridge</strong>, which you can look out over after you drive across it. This striking bridge spans a deep canyon gorge of the Rio Grande River in the middle of the desert. Depending on which route you take from the San Luis Valley, it might be better to visit the bridge before Taos.</p>`,
