The city of Bodie sits at a very high elevation of 8,400 feet (2,560 m) and is surrounded by beautiful scenery.</p><p>When you arrive in Bodie be sure to head to the former town hall building to sign up for a tour of the giant mine, which can not be accessed otherwise.</p>`,

    body: `<p>Death Valley National Park is a vast beautiful landscape of mountains and desert filled with rare and unique geological formations. Be aware that the national park is one of the hottest places in the world and should not be ventured into during the summer months. Fall or Spring is the perfect time to visit the national park, when the climate is more moderate and bearable.</p><p>The following attractions are listed in order along a recommended route through this national park. Note that it's also highly recommended to get a very early start on the day if you wish to experience much of what this majestic landscape has to offer.</p>`,

    body: `<h3>Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes</h3><p>Begin your day in the Stovepipe Wells area of the park near the southwestern entrance. You can start your journey through Death Valley by visiting the expansive <strong>Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes</strong>, which you can wander amongst while enjoying views of the surrounding mountains. There are no set hiking trails in this giant sea of sand, however you'll get the best views over the area from atop the tallest sand dunes.</p><h3>Salt Creek</h3><p>Continue to the <strong>Salt Creek Interpretive Trail</strong>, a boardwalk which follows along a scenic creek seeming misplaced in the middle of the desert. Along the creek is one of the few places in Death Valley where you'll find lots of vegetation, and the creek is even home to a species of fish. The round-trip length of the boardwalk trail is approximately 0.9 miles (1.4 km).</p>`,

The short and smooth dirt road through the canyon is an alternate route to reach the next attraction, the <strong>Harmony Borax Works</strong>. The Borax Works features a short trail around the fascinating ruins of a 19th century borax plant as well as historic wagons.</p><p>Just beyond the Harmony Borax Works is Furnace Creek, a small town which hosts accommodations, food, and the national park's Furnace Creek Visitor Center.</p>`,

This extremely scenic hike ventures through a desolate desert canyon, concluding at the Red Cathedral formation. The round-trip length for this trail is about about 3 miles (4.8 km).</p>`,
    hidden_content: `<p>You might consider extending this hike into a 6.7 mile (10.8 km) round-trip trail, passing through beautiful rugged canyons before arriving at gorgeous Zabriskie Point.

From the parking area you can walk along the 1.8 mile (2.9 km) round-trip pathway which descends to the lowest elevation point. Also be sure to look back at the marker on the cliffs above the parking lot, which indicates sea level and gives you a perspective of how low the elevation of the basin is.</p><p>After enjoying the Badwater Basin you can turn around and head north towards more attractions.</p><h3>Natural Bridge Trail</h3><p>Just north of Badwater is the popular <strong>Natural Bridge Trail</strong>, which ventures through a rocky lifeless canyon before arriving at an impressive bridge formation which the trail passes under. This easy trail is approximately 1.3 miles (2.1 km) round-trip.<h3>Artist's Palette</h3><p>Take the alternate route while heading back north from Badwater Basin along the extremely scenic Artists Drive. Along this road you can stop at the <strong>Artist's Palette</strong>, a stunning natural formation of vibrant colorful cliffs.</p>`,

    hidden_content: `<h3>Racetrack Playa</h3><p>One of Death Valley's most famous attractions is the mystical <strong>Racetrack Playa</strong>, a vast dried lakebed famous for its Sailing Stones, where rocks seemingly drag across the desert floor leaving very long tracks behind them. It was only recently discovered that these rocks move along the cracked desert floor under certain conditions of wind and very thin floating ice panels in the winter.</p><p>Within the playa is a large rocky island called the Grandstand, a surprising geological feature rising above the almost perfectly flat landscape.</p><p>The Racetrack Playa is located near the Teakettle Junction and can be reached by off-road vehicle from the Ubehebe Crater in approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes (each way).</p><h3>Eureka Sand Dunes</h3><p>Approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes from the Ubehebe Crater in a different valley then the Racetrack Playa are the massive <strong>Eureka Sand Dunes</strong>, which rise nearly 680 feet (210 m) above the Eureka Valley. Stunningly, the Eureka Sand Dunes are among the tallest dune fields in North America.</p><p>The mesmerizing Eureka Dunes are an excellent place to wander around and explore. Adjacent to these remote dunes is a campsite.</p>`

Along the drive through the park are many scenic pull-offs you should consider stopping at in addition to the listed attractions.</p><h3>Hidden Valley Nature Trail</h3><p>First you'll come across the 1 mile (1.6 km) round-trip <strong>Hidden Valley Nature Trail</strong>, which loops around a stunning area of complex rock formations and Joshua trees.</p><h3>Barker Dam Nature Trail</h3><p>Nearby Hidden Valley is the 1.2 mile (1.9 km) round-trip <strong>Barker Dam Nature Trail</strong>, which ventures along a similar landscape that includes a seasonal lake as well as petroglyphs. These two easy trails are the park's most popular hikes and are highly recommended.</p>`,

The very short Cap Rock Nature Trail circles around some of these rocks.</p><h3>Keys View</h3><p>From Cap Rock you can take a detour heading south up to <strong>Keys View</strong>, a breathtaking viewpoint that overlooks Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley from high above. Keys View provides amazing views in the day, and especially at night when the cities of the Coachella Valley brilliantly light up.</p><h3>Hall of Horrors</h3><p>Next you can visit the <strong>Hall of Horrors</strong>, another scenic rocky area that's popular for rock climbing (with and without gear) which you might explore a bit.</p>`,

This strange rock is a very short walk away from Skull Rock.</p><p>Another interesting rock formation nearby Skull Rock is Split Rock, which you can see via a 1.9 mile (3.1 km) round-trip trail.</p><h3>Arch Rock</h3><p>Next you can see another impressive rock formation via the 0.5 mile (0.8 km) round-trip <strong>Arch Rock Nature Trail</strong>, which offers a short but scenic journey to a natural arch.

This trailhead is located near the national park's other visitor center, the Cottonwood Visitor Center, which is also near where the park's main road intersects Highway 10.</p><h3>Fortynine Palms Oasis Trail</h3><p>Another short hike you might consider is the 2.8 mile (4.5 km) round-trip <strong>Fortynine Palms Oasis Trail</strong>, which ventures through the dry desert before leading to a surprising small water oasis surrounded by many palm trees.

This massive lake sits along the border of California and Nevada, and the area around the lake offers many different types of activities year-round. In the summer there's great hiking opportunities, as well as beautiful beaches offering swimming and kayaking. In the winter the area offers countless ski resorts to experience.</p>`,

Here you'll find <strong>The Shops at Heavenly Village</strong>, an outdoor mall which resembles a majestic mountain lodge.</p><h3>Stateline, Nevada</h3><p>Just a couple blocks away within walking distance of Heavenly Village is the Nevada border town of <strong>Stateline</strong>, which hosts four Las Vegas-like mega casinos.</p><h3>Nevada Beach</h3><p>A bit north of Stateline and South Lake Tahoe is <strong>Nevada Beach</strong>, where the pine forest quickly turns into a vibrant sandy beach, from which you can enjoy striking views of the surrounding mountains over the lake.</p>`,

Here you can take amazing views over the bay as well as of nearby <strong>Eagle Falls</strong> which flows into the lake.</p><p>Nearby Eagle Falls you can hike down to the castle-like <strong>Vikingsholm</strong>, an impressive historic mansion which sits on the lakeshore and offers tours in the warmer seasons. This popular hike to Vikingsholm is about 1.6 miles round-trip. Adjacent to the mansion is a beach and kayak rental from which you can explore Emerald Bay and the nearby Fannette Island.</p><p>Just east of Emerald Bay is another vibrant sandy beach with stunning clear waters, <strong>Baldwin Beach</strong>.

Close-by is the 1.4 mile (2.3 km) round-trip trail to the lovely <strong>Cascade Falls</strong>, which also hosts views over Cascade Lake below. The Cascade Falls Trail begins from the Bayview Trailhead.</p><h3>Maggies Peak & Granite Lake</h3><p>From the same Bayview Trailhead is a more challenging and rewarding hike to consider, the Granite Lake Trail. This hike passes the serene Granite Lake before reaching the top of <strong>Maggies Peak South</strong>, from which you can enjoy incredible views over Emerald Bay and part of Lake Tahoe. This trail has about 1,750 feet (540 m) of elevation gain and a round-trip distance of 3.8 miles (6.1 km).</p>`,

Sand Harbor sits at the eastern edge of Lake Tahoe's Crystal Bay.</p><h3>Bonsai Rock</h3><p>Nearby Sand Harbor is the picturesque <strong>Bonsai Rock</strong>, an iconic rock just off the coast which has a small bonasi-like tree atop it. You can pull off the highway and take a very short hike down to the water to admire this amazing natural feature.</p><h3>Thunderbird Lodge</h3><p>Just south of the Bonsai Tree is the <strong>Thunderbird Lodge Preservation</strong>, a lovely historic cabin-like mansion located which hosts a scenic lakeside garden and excellent lake views. You can make reservations if you'd like to tour this historic structure.</p><h3>Stateline Fire Lookout</h3><p>At the center of the northern side of Lake Tahoe is one of the lake's greatest lookout points, the <strong>Historic Stateline Fire Lookout</strong> (also known as Crystal Bay Scenic Overlook), which offers gorgeous views overlooking the lake and Crystal Bay from high above. You can reach this viewpoint via a 1.5 mile (2.4 km) round-trip trail starting from the bottom of Lookout Road.</p>`,

    body: `<p>This area of Northern California is home to several amazing waterfalls as well as a beautiful volcano landscape, known as Lassen Volcanic National Park. While driving along this route you'll be able to take in excellent views of stunning Mt. Shasta, which towers high above the surrounding landscape.</p><p>The following attractions are listed in order along a recommended route around this area. Be sure to get an extremely early start on the day or even spread this itinerary out over two days if you wish to see all of these attractions.</p>`,

    body: `<p>Just south of the town of Mt. Shasta is the gorgeous yet elusive <strong>Mossbrae Falls</strong>, which many claim is among the most beautiful waterfalls in California. Unfortunately there is no established trail to reach the waterfalls yet, however there is still an easy route.</p><p>Park along the road on Dunsmuir Avenue just south of Scarlett Way near the Cave Springs Resort (but definitely don't park at the resort). From the road you'll walk north, and then turn left onto Scarlett Way, which merges with Cave Avenue. Cave Avenue becomes a small bridge crossing the Sacramento River. Just after crossing the bridge you'll see the railroad tracks to your right (on the northern side), which you'll walk on the side of heading until you reach the falls.</p>`,
    hidden_content: `<p>This flat walk is approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) round-trip. This popular walk is very safe and as long as you walk on the river side of the tracks (eastern side) and do not walk along or near the tracks, as trains do frequently pass by. Just before reaching the next railroad bridge you'll head down to the river where the hidden Mossbrae Falls are located.</p>`

All three of these beautiful waterfalls are quite different looking and can be admired with short walks from their parking lots.</p>`,

    body: `<p>After enjoying the many beautiful waterfalls around Mt. Shasta you can begin your extremely scenic drive through Lassen Volcanic National Park, which is only open during the warmer months due to its very high elevation.</p><h3>Subway Cave Lava Tube</h3><p>Before reaching the national park you might like to stop along the highway for a short but exciting underground walk via the <strong>Subway Cave Trail</strong>, which travels through a remarkable lava tube. Be sure to bring a flashlight and jacket for this 0.6 miles (1 km) round-trip walk.</p><h3>Bumpass Hell Trail</h3><p>The best trail the park has to offer is the 2.7 mile (4.3 km) round-trip <strong>Bumpass Hell Trail</strong>, which takes you on a journey amongst a stunning volcanically active landscape of geothermal pools, steaming holes in the ground, and colored hills. The sights among this amazing trail are reminiscent of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.</p><h3>Sulphur Works</h3><p>Continue your drive through the park, stopping at the various viewpoints along the road, before reaching the <strong>Sulphur Works</strong> volcanic area which you can take admire with a short walk. In this area you can also explore amongst the scenic meadows if you like, before leaving the park.</p>`,

From atop the Cinder Cone you can enjoy stunning panoramic views over the area.</p><p>This trail is located in the remote northeastern section of the park, which you can access to the east of the Subway Cave Lava Tubes. Note that this trail is quite a drive away from Highway 89 and the main part of the park. The trailhead is located adjacent to the Butte Lake Ranger Station.</p>`,

    body: `<p>San Francisco is a gorgeous highly-urbanized city located at the tip of a hilly peninsula at the entrance to the vast San Francisco Bay. The city features many iconic sights and important museums, and is one of the United States' few cities that has a great public transportation network (but also terrible car parking).</p>`,

    body: `<p>San Francisco's most iconic sight is the massive Golden Gate Bridge, which spans the entrance to the San Francisco Bay. From the San Francisco side you can take in direct views from just below the bridge at <strong>Fort Point</strong>, a former Civil War fortress that's also quite interesting to explore. Another great place to take in views of the bridge is <strong>Baker Beach</strong>, from which you can see the Golden Gate set against the mountains and ocean.</p><p>Be sure to experience the incredible views from the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge as well, as you can view the bridge set against the San Francisco skyline. The viewpoints on the other side include the Golden Gate Bridge Vista Point immediately at the end of the bridge, as well as <strong>Battery Spencer</strong>, another old military structure that you can explore.</p><p>If you'd like to walk across the Golden Gate Bridge, the one-way distance across the bridge from the Welcome Center to the Golden Gate Bridge Vista Point is about 1.9 miles (3.1 km). It's an additional 0.7 miles (1.1 km) each way to walk to Battery Spencer, with the possibility of continuing along the cliffs to additional batteries and viewpoints. Afterwards there's the possibility of taking the bus back across the bridge, which picks up near the Vista Point. </p><h3>Twin Peaks View of San Francisco</h3><p>Some of the most amazing views over the city of San Francisco can be enjoyed from <strong>Christmas Tree Point</strong> atop Twin Peaks, a large hill in the middle of the city, set further back from the coast.</p>`,

The trail journeys alongside a rocky stream inside of this vibrant canyon, with many wooden bridges and fallen branches along the serene rocky creek.

    body: `<p>Continue south to the Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, which features two incredible trails. Both of these trails are the highest recommended attractions along the Upper Northern Coast.</p><h3>Fern Canyon Trail</h3><p>First you can hike the breathtaking <strong>Fern Canyon Trail</strong>, a 1.1 mile (1.8 km) round-trip hike which ventures through a stunning canyon surrounded by lush green walls on both sides. The trail journeys alongside a rocky stream inside of this vibrant canyon, with many wooden bridges and fallen branches along the serene rocky creek. Reaching the trailhead for the popular Fern Canyon is a bit challenging but definitely worth it.</p><h3>Lady Bird Johnson Grove Trail</h3><p>Just south of Fern Canyon you can hike the wondrous 1.3 mile (2.1 km) round-trip <strong>Lady Bird Johnson Grove Trail</strong> through an extremely scenic and wondrous redwood forest, which is among the best redwood hikes you'll find in Northern California.</p><p>If you're able to spread out this itinerary out over at least two days, it is highly recommended to hike the Lady Bird Johnson Grove Trail in the early morning when the fog gives the forest a beautiful mystical look.</p>`,

This 32 mile (51 km) long road offers much better views of the towering redwood trees than the main highway.</p><p>Some great short hikes you might consider within the Humboldt Redwoods State Park are the 0.5 mile (0.8 km) round-trip <strong>Founders Grove Nature Trail</strong>, and the nearby 1.1 mile (1.8 km) round-trip <strong>Rockefeller Loop Trail</strong>. Both of these trails journey through the lush dense redwood forests.</p>`,

The trail has a huge elevation gain of nearly 3,200 feet (980 m) and also offers views of the cascading pools that lead to the waterfall.</p><h3>Cook's Meadow</h3><p>Near Yosemite Falls be sure to walk along the <strong>Cook's Meadow Loop</strong> boardwalk, which ventures through an open meadow, from which you can enjoy unobstructed views of Yosemite Falls and the surrounding canyon walls. Cook's Meadow Loop is also an incredible place to see the many stars of the night sky framed by the canyon.</p>`,
